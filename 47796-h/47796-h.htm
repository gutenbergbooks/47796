<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the multitude of
books that have been written relating to
its history and antiquities, the History of London
still remains to be written, a work that cannot,
from its ocean-like infinitude of matter, be
accomplished by a single hand, but will require
the combined action of a multiplicity of
labourers.</p>

<p>By London is here meant, not the vast aggregation
of buildings and population spreading into
four or five counties but that small fraction lying
north and south of the Thames, which is under
the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor of London—that
portion which was a considerable emporium
of trade under the Celtic Trinobantes; a
military post and seat of commerce under the
Romans, with roads, of which one still retains its
name of Watling Street, in the centre of London,
all radiating from a central miliarium, which may
still be seen, a venerable relic of sixteen centuries
of age, in the wall of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Swithin's Church; which
was a capital city and place of great mercantile
importance under the Saxons and the Danes, and
has in the subsequent thousand years, gradually
expanded its limits, and gathered population,
wealth, and commerce, until it has become the
capital of the world, in magnitude and wealth
unprecedented, to which the capitals of other
nations are but as provincial cities: so vast and
rich that Blucher might well exclaim, when
shewn its banks and docks, its warehouses and
shops—"Ye gods! what a place to sack."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many books in existence,
descriptive of the various phases of London, it
appeared to the publishers there was still room
for a small, handy, and compact volume, of
moderate price, which should give a clear and
comprehensive view of some of the more salient
features of the bygone history of the old city,
which they presume to hope may be found in this
volume.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>The Walls and Gates.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> prehistoric ages the valley of the Thames
formed the bed of an estuary or arm of the
sea, whose waters flowed over the low lands
of Essex, and whose waves dashed against the
sloping uplands of Middlesex and Surrey, on
whose summits now stand the Crystal and
Alexandra Palaces. In process of time, by the
deposition of silt brought down from the west,
and of sand brought up by the flow of the tide,
the estuary was reduced to a river, afterwards
still further reduced in width by the embankments
made by the Romans along the coast of
Essex; and the land intervening between the
then and the former shores became a succession
of fens and morasses, some of which remained to
comparatively modern times, and have their
localities indicated by such names as Moorfields,
Fenchurch, Marsh-gate, Lambeth, etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Amongst these morasses were oases of high
and firm land; and beyond, spreading up and
over the slopes of the uplands, there grew a
dense forest, the home of wolves, boars, and other
wild animals. Upon one of these spots of dry
land, at the time of the invasion of Cæsar, might
be seen a village of wattled or mud-built and
thatched huts, inhabited by the Celtic aborigines,
with cattle and hogs feeding in the midst, a few
patches of cultivated land, and beyond, the
forest. This was the nucleus of the mighty
London of the present, and is supposed to have
occupied a space of some quarter of a mile along
the river shore, with Dowgate for its centre, and
stretching northward as far as Cheapside. In all
probability it would be surrounded by earthworks,
ditches, and stockades, for the purpose of
defence, and would otherwise be protected by the
broad stream of the Thames, and by the Fleet
river on the west, and Walbrook on the east.</p>

<p>When the Romans completed the subjugation
of the southern part of Britain and began to
make settlements, their practical sagacity at once
perceived the eligibility of this spot as a centre
of commerce; and in a short time it put on the
appearance of a Roman city, and gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>became adorned with residential houses after the
Roman fashion—whose tesselated pavements and
other decorations are still often exhumed—with
marts of commerce, temples of the gods, basilicæ,
baths, amphitheatres, and other architectural
appliances of an important city.</p>

<p>At what period the Romans substituted a wall
of defence in place of the old earthworks is
uncertain, but previous to its construction they
appeared to have erected two forts on the north
bank of the Thames—one at the eastern
extremity of the City, where the tower now
stands; the other at the western end, where the
Fleet fell into the Thames. That it was an open
town, or very imperfectly defended, in the middle
of the first century, is evidenced by the facility
with which Queen Boadicea, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Nero, entered
it with her army, slaughtered the inhabitants,
and most probably burnt it, as the charred
remains of a great conflagration have been
frequently found in making deep excavations.
Henry of Huntingdon, and some other of the
old chroniclers, tell us that it was first walled by
Constantine the Great, at the request of his
mother Helena, and that the materials he made
use of were hewn stone and British bricks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>that it was in compass about three miles.
Camden seems to credit this statement, from the
fact that coins of the Empress Helena have been
found under the wall, but as these might have
been in circulation long after her death, it only
goes to prove that the wall was not built before
her era. Constantine died in the year 337, and we
find some twenty-five years afterwards London was
entered and pillaged, and the inhabitants reduced
to a state of great misery, by a combined army
of Picts, Scots, Saxons, and Franks, which would
scarcely have been possible if it had been walled,
and defended by the disciplined soldiers of the
empire. The probability seems to be that the
walls were either built or commenced by
Theodosius, the Roman general, afterwards
emperor, who in the reign of Valentinian, came
to Britain with an army, utterly routed the
pirates and freebooters, and entered London in
triumph, where he remained for a considerable
period; and we are told by Ammianus Marcellinus
that before he left the island he restored
to their ancient sound condition both the towns
and military strongholds throughout the country,
and put everything in such a state of defence that
peace was maintained until the reign of Honorius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>when Britain was abandoned by the Romans.
Hence we may arrive at an approximate date for
the building of the walls. Constantine came to
the throne in 306, and Valentinian died 375: and
it is almost certain that it took place some time
within these 70 years, the balance of evidence
seeming to refer it farther to the period of the
sojourn of Theodosius in Britain, or about
368-70.</p>

<p>Fitzstephen is the earliest writer who mentions
the wall. He lived in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>,
towards the end of the twelfth century, and
describes the wall as high and thick, with seven
double gates and many towers and turrets placed
at proper distances. Originally there were only
four exits from the City—by way of Aldgate on
the east, Cripplegate on the north, Newgate on
the west, and Dowgate on the south; the latter
was the entrance to the "Trajectus," or ferry
across the Thames, and derived its name from
Dwr or Dour—water; or perhaps from Dwyr
Dover, as leading to the Dover-road. Near to
this gate was placed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miliarium</i>, a portion of
which may still be seen in the wall of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Swithin's Church, whence distances were
measured along the roads, and from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>radiated four roads—one by Dowgate and across
into Kent, and three others which passed
respectively through Aldgate, Cripplegate, and
Ludgate. The wall commenced at the eastern
fort, and had a postern gate at its commencement
which occupied the position of the row of posts in
Postern-row, north of the Tower, whence it ran
northward to Aldgate, the eastern exit (some
portions of the old wall are still remaining at the
back of the houses in America Crescent); from
Aldgate it went in a north-western direction
between Hounds-ditch and Camomile Street to
Bishopgate, whence it proceeded directly west to
Cripplegate. In the street called London-wall a
fragment may be seen, and the remains of a
bastion may be found between <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles's Church
and the Barber Surgeons' Hall. From this point
it turned southward for a short distance down
Noble Street, and again deflected to the west,
arriving at Aldersgate, after which it passed <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Botolph's Church and Christ's Hospital, then
turned southward at a sharp angle, coming to
Ludgate (which stood immediately to the west of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's Church), and hence to the Thames.
In 1276 that portion south of Ludgate was taken
down, and a new wall built from Ludgate to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Fleet river, and hence south to the Thames, so as
to enclose the new Blackfriars' Monastery. It has
been doubted whether the wall was continued
along the river bank, but Fitzstephen says:—"London
once had its walls and towers on the
south, but that vast river, the Thames, which
abounds with fish, and enjoys the benefit of tides,
and washes the City on this side, hath in a long
track of time totally subverted and carried them
away;" and adds, that in his day some relics
might be seen. Salmon, in his <cite>Survey of
England</cite>, vol. i., disputes this, chiefly on the
ground that we have no historical account of any
great inundation such as would be necessary to
effect such a result; and Maitland combats his
arguments at great length, contending that a
period of 777 years was quite sufficient to account
for their decay and disappearance; and Lord
Lyttelton remarks that long previously it had
not been necessary to repair the south wall, the
Tower and the bridge being amply sufficient to
prevent a hostile fleet approaching the City.</p>

<p>In the year 1707 considerable portions of the
wall were laid bare in digging for the foundations
of some houses near Bishopsgate, which Dr.
Woodward carefully examined, and gave a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>description of the materials and construction in
"Remarks upon the Ancient and Present State
of London: Occasioned by some Roman urns,
etc., discovered near Bishopgate," originally
published in the eighth volume of Leland's
<cite>Itinerary</cite>, and afterwards separately. He says:
"It was compiled alternately of layers of broad
flat bricks and of ragstone. The bricks lay in
double ranges, and each brick being but one inch
and three tenths in thickness, the whole layer,
with the mortar interposed, exceeded not three
inches. The layers of stone were not quite two
feet thick of our measure. To this height (eight
feet) the workmanship was after the Roman
manner, and these were the remains of the
ancient wall. In this it was very observable that
the mortar was, as usual in the Roman work, so
very firm and hard that the stone itself was
easily broke and gave way as that. It was thus
far from the foundation nine feet in thickness.
The broad thin bricks above mentioned were
all of Roman make, and of the sort, as we learn
from Pliny, that were in common use among the
Romans, being in length one foot and a half of
their standard, and in breadth one foot. The old
wall having been demolished, was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>repaired and carried up of the same thickness to
eight or nine feet in height; or, if higher, there
was no more of that work now standing. All
this was apparently additional, and of a make
later than the part underneath it. The outside,
towards the suburbs, was faced with a coarse sort
of stone, not compiled with care, nor disposed
into a regular method; but on the inside there
appeared more marks of workmanship and art.
There was not one of the broad thin Roman
bricks mentioned above in all this part, nor was
the mortar near so hard as in that below; but
from the description it may be easily collected
that this part, when first made and entire, with
so various and orderly a disposition of the
materials—flint, stone, and bricks—could not but
carry a very elegant and handsome aspect.
Upon the additional work now described was
raised a wall wholly of brick, only that it
terminated in battlements topped with copings
of stone. It was two feet four inches in thickness,
and somewhat above eight feet in height....
This wall was strengthened and embellished
with stately towers, which on the south,
together with the wall, are long since become a
prey to the tide and weather; but the remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>those on the land side, being fifteen in number,
are still to be seen: one thereof, about the middle
of Houndsditch, is a Roman construction,
composed of stone with layers of bricks. It is
situated almost opposite the end of Gravel Lane,
on the west of Houndsditch, and is still three
stories high, but sorely decayed and rent from top
to bottom in divers parts."</p>

<p>The height of the Roman wall is supposed to
have been about twenty-two feet, and that of the
towers about forty. Besides these towers there
were bastions and other defensive works usual in
fortifications. In Vineyard Street, on the south
of Aldgate, the base of a tower about eight feet
high was made use of for a new superstructure early
in the last century, upon which had been fixed
a stone with this inscription:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"Glory be to God on high, who was graciously
pleased in a wonderful manner to preserve the
lives of all the people in this house, twelve in
number, when the ould wall of this Bulwark fell
down three stories high, and so broad as two
cartes might enter a breast, and yet without any
harm to their persones. The Lord sanctify this his
great providence unto them. Amen and Amen.
It was Tuesday, the 23rd September, 1651."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>There is reason for believing that the first
western wall ran southward, with a slight
inclination to the west, from Cripplegate to the
Thames, passing eastward of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, as urns
and other sepulchral remains have been found
between this line and that indicated above. The
Romans never buried their dead within the walls,
consequently this locality must at some period
have been extramural; and it would appear that
as these remains have been found beneath
pavements, as the City grew in population and
required more space for the habitations of the
living, the old graveyards were built over. Some
forty years ago, in sinking a shaft in Paternoster
Row, the excavators met, at a depth of eighteen
feet, a stone wall of such intense hardness that it
took the workmen three or four days to cut
through it. This is supposed to have been a
portion of the primitive wall, and is described by
C. Roach Smith in the <cite>Archæologist</cite>, vol.
<abbr title="twenty seven">xxvii.</abbr>, pp. 140-53.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Romans, the wall
appears to have fallen to decay, and the City was
easily taken by the Saxon pirates, who also
neglected defences of this description to a great
extent, trusting more to their own valour than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>bricks and mortar. It would no doubt suffer
greatly in the destruction of its towers and
bastions in the three great conflagrations which
occurred in the years 764, 798, and 801, and
consumed the greater part of the City. Such
being the case, it fell an easy prey to the Danes,
who in 851 sailed up the Thames with a fleet of
350 ships, speedily reduced it, and garrisoned
it as a basis whence to attack Wessex. Alfred
the Great succeeded to the throne of Wessex in
871, and from that period to 878 he fought no
less than fifty-six battles with the invaders. In
884 he laid siege to London, drove out the Danes
and compelled them to capitulate, after which he
repaired the walls and forts, and appointed his
son-in-law, Ethelred, governor. The repairs
appear to have been of a substantial character, as
when Anlaf and Swegen, or Sweyn, the kings of
Norway and Denmark, attacked the City, with a
fleet of 94 ships, in 994, the citizens were enabled
to defy all their endeavours to enter within
the walls, and compelled them to raise the siege
with great loss, as happened again in 1013, when
the city was defended by Ethelred <abbr title="the second">II</abbr>. But
after some successes elsewhere, Sweyn returned,
and again laid siege to the City; and again the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>citizens might have closed their gates against him,
but Ethelred, their king, pusillanimously fled to
Normandy, and the citizens deemed it best to
submit, whereupon the gates were thrown open,
the Danes admitted, and Sweyn proclaimed King
of England.</p>

<p>Sweyn did not long enjoy this dignity; he died
the following spring, when the Londoners
recalled Ethelred: and he also dying soon after.
Edmund Ironsides, his son, was proclaimed king,
and crowned in London. Canute, the son of
Sweyn, however, claimed the crown won by the
prowess of his father, and came with a large fleet
up the Thames, but could not pass beyond the
bridge, and finding he could make no impression
on the eastern walls and forts, he cut a canal
across Southwark and Lambeth, availing himself
of certain watercourses, and conveyed his ships
into the Thames somewhere about Vauxhall,
whence he sailed downward, and attacked the
western walls and towers; but the undaunted
bravery of the citizens and the strength of their
defences compelled him to raise the siege. Soon
after, however, a treaty was entered into between
Edmund and Canute for the division of the
kingdom: and London falling to the share of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>latter, he took up his winter quarters there. By
the death of Edmund a few months after, Canute
became sole monarch of England.</p>

<p>After the battle of Hastings, William the
Conqueror marched upon London, but was
opposed by a body of the citizens in Southwark,
whom he repulsed; but recognising their valour
and perceiving the strength of the City's
fortifications, he went to subdue the Western
Counties, and his success in that direction showed
the Londoners that the wisest and most politic
course would be to submit; when the Norman
duke entered the City, and was presented with
the keys and acknowledged as King of England.
He was no sooner in possession of the City than
he caused three castles to be erected, ostensibly
for the protection of the City, but really to overawe
the inhabitants. These were the Tower at the
eastern, and Baynard and Montfichet Castles at
the western, extremity of the walls. The Tower
became the residence of the Norman kings, and
Baynard Castle that of the chatelain and
standard-bearer of the City—offices held first by
the Baynards, and afterwards by the Barons
Fitzwalter. Montfichet Castle was destroyed by
fire in the reign of William, and the Black Friars'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Monastery built on the site—the best of the
stones being used in the re-edification of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Paul's Cathedral, which had been destroyed by
fire.</p>

<p>Fitzstephen speaks of the walls being "both
high and thick, with seven double gates," which
appear then to have been in good condition,
although the south wall had been "subverted
and carried away by the tide." But very soon
after some portions seem to have fallen into a
ruinous condition; as Roger of Wendover and
Matthew Paris tell us that the barons, when in
arms against King John, in 1215, entered the
City by Ealdgate, and demolished the houses of
the Jews, to obtain materials wherewith to repair
that gate and the adjoining walls. In 1257, also,
it is stated, Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> "caused the walls, which
were greatly decayed, and destitute of towers and
turrets, to be repaired in a handsomer manner
than before, at the common charge of the City."</p>

<p>King Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> granted permission to
Kilwarby, Archbishop of Canterbury, to take
down the wall, from Ludgate to the Thames, for
the purpose of enlarging the Church of the Black
Friars, and in 1282 granted a murage charter to
the Corporation for levying certain tolls throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>the kingdom, for making a new wall from
Ludgate—westward to Fleet Bridge, along behind
the houses and by the water of the Fleet to the
Thames, "from the aforesaid day to the end of
three years next following," from which none were
exempt, saving the city of Winchester, and a few
other cities, which, by composition, were to pay
no Portage, Murage, or Pannage. After an
enumeration of the articles to be subjected to toll,
amongst which are: "Riges, Cetewal, Kanel,
Frankincense, Cummin, Liquorish, Zuber, Cyromontani,
Frails of Figs," etc., is added, "Whereas
we have granted you for aid of the work of the
walls of our City and the closure of the same,
divers customs of vendible things, coming to the
said City, to be taken for a certain time, we
command you that you cause to be finished the
wall of the said City now begun near the Friars-preachers,
and a certain good and comely tower
at the head of the said wall within the water of
the Thames," etc. Similar letters were issued by
Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> in the first, second, sixth, eighth, and
twelfth years of his reign; but as it was found
that levying a toll on retail commodities caused
an insufficient supply, the patent ran in the
latter year, that—"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Victualia non adducuntur, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>detrimentum civitatis</span>;" but that impositions
should be levied in bulk on all merchandise
brought by land or water. Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, in a
letter to the Corporation, said in the preamble:
"Know ye, that whereas the walls and forts of
the City be old and weak, and for want of repair
are fallen down in some places, as also the ditches of
the said City are exceeding filled with dirt,
dunghills, and other filth, not only to the evident
danger of the said City and inhabitants thereof,
but also to the manifest disgrace and scandal of
the whole City," etc.; and granted to the Mayor
and Corporation power to levy tolls for ten years
for the purpose of placing the wall in a state of
thorough repair. In order to enforce these
murage tolls it was customary to have chains
fixed across the entrances to the City, and no
country people with provisions for sale were
allowed to pass until they had paid the dues.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, Ralph Joscelyne,
the mayor, repaired the wall from Aldgate to
Aldersgate, for which purpose he caused bricks
to be made in Moorfields, where also the lime
brought from Kent was burnt for that purpose.
This was in the year 1477, and several of the
City companies—the Drapers (of which company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the mayor was a member), the Skinners,
the Goldsmiths, and others—contributed to the
work, and placed their arms on the portions they
executed. The executors of Sir John Crosby
also contributed freely out of the funds they held
in trust towards the same object. By an order
of the Common Council each parishioner also was
directed to pay sixpence every Sunday at his
Parish Church until the work was completed.
After this the walls were neglected and suffered
to fall in ruin. Camden, writing in 1607, says
that the north wall "having been repaired by
one Joscelin, who was mayor, it put on, as it
were, a new face and freshness, but that towards
the east and west, though the barons repaired it
in their wars of the demolished houses of the
Jews, is all ruinous and going to decay. For the
Londoners, like the Lacedæmonians of old, do
slight fenced cities, as fit for nothing but women
to live in, and look upon their own City to be
safe, not by the assistance of stones, but by the
courage of its inhabitants." Nevertheless when
the Civil Wars between Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> and his
Parliament had fairly commenced, the citizens
bethought them of their walls and forts as no
contemptible means of defence. London had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>declared most decisively for the Parliament;
and in 1643, the Common Council gave directions
that the ditches should be cleaned out of the
accumulations of rubbish, all outside buildings
cleared away, the bulwarks put in repair and
mounted with cannon, and new works added to
the weaker parts of the walls. The Parliament
confirmed this resolution, and extended a plan of
fortification, so as to include Southwark and
Westminster. A chain of forts surrounding the
whole, and lines of communication, were ordered
to be erected. All the entrances to the City
were closed excepting those at Charing Cross,
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles-in-the-Fields, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John's Street, Shoreditch,
and Whitechapel; and these were fortified
with musket proof breastworks. To carry out
these extensive works a levy was made of eight-fifteenths
on all the wards of the City, which was
cheerfully assented to by the citizens, and the
works were commenced without delay, and carried
on with such zeal and alacrity that the whole was
completed in an incredibly short space of time.
In the year 1647, when the dispute was raging
between the Presbyterians and the Independents,
the city was divided in opinion: but when the
army under Fairfax advanced from Hounslow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>upon London, the Mayor and Corporation met
and saluted the general at Charing Cross; and
by an ordnance of Parliament he was constituted
Constable of the Tower, the army thus becoming
masters of the City. The Parliament then
demanded a loan of £50,000 from the City, which
was not complied with and in consequence an Act
was passed for demolishing the fortifications of
London, Westminster, and Southwark.</p>

<p>Whether the Roman wall was protected by a
ditch does not appear; probably not, as the first
mention we have of one being made is by
Dunthorn, who informs us that William, Bishop
of Ely, Regent of England when Richard <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> was
absent in Palestine, made a ditch round the
Tower as a defence against John, the King's
brother, soon after which the citizens dug a ditch
round the walls generally, which they commenced
about 1190, but left it unfinished until 1213, as
the register of Barmondsey states, when it was
recommenced, and completed in two years. This
ditch was 200 feet broad, but was afterwards
neglected, and gardens planted and houses built
upon it. In 1354, Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> caused it to be
cleansed; and again in 1379, by direction of Lord
Mayor Philpot, as also by Lord Mayor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Fawconer, in 1414, and  Lord Mayor Joceline, in
1477. In 1519, 10th Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, it was
"cleansed and scowered" between Aldgate and
the Tower—the chief ditcher being paid 7d. per
day, the second ditcher 6d., other ditchers 5d.,
and every "vagabond" (labourer) one penny and
meat and drink at the charge of the City. It
was cleansed out again in 1549 at the expense of
the trade guilds, and twenty years after, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i>
Elizabeth, at a cost of £814 15s. 8d., at which
time "it had therein great store of good fish of
divers sorts." After this the expense was
defrayed by letting the banks and "the whole
spoil of the ditch," excepting in 1595, when the
Common Council granted two-fifteens for the
purpose. In the following century the ditch was
filled up, excepting Fleet Ditch on the west,
which, after the Fire of 1666, was, by direction of
the Mayor and Court of Aldermen, ordered to be
cleansed, enlarged, and made navigable for barges
up to Holborn-bridge. The sides were built of
freestone, and it was arranged that its banks
should be lined with warehouses and wharves,
but this part of the project was not carried out
in its integrity. "This ditch was built and made
by Sir Thomas Fitch, bricklayer, who contracted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>with the City for a very considerable sum, and
enriched himself thereby." In 1723 the
Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament for
filling up the channel from Fleet-bridge to
Holborn-bridge, which had become choked with
mud and was no longer navigable, and to build
thereon a new market in place of Stocks Market,
near the Exchange, which it was proposed to
dismarket and demolish, and erect on the site a
Mansion House for the Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>We have seen that in the old Roman walls
there were four gates, the exits of four roads
radiating from the "milliarum," now called
London Stone. These gates were—Aldgate
on the east, Aldersgate on the north, Ludgate on
the west, and Dowgate on the south. What
were the architectural features of these gates we
know not, but undoubtedly they were similar
to the usual Roman gateways, with round-arched
openings and fortified upper chambers for the
purpose of defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aldgate</span>, or Ealdgate, so called by the Saxons
on account of its antiquity, was placed by King
Eadger in the hands of the knights of the
Knighten Guild, who held the soke, now called
Potsoken Ward Without, by charter.  Afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>it became part of the demesne of Maud,
queen of Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, who bestowed it upon the prior
and canons of her foundation, the Priory of the
Holy Trinity, along with the soke and franchise
of the ward. In 1215, the barons, in their war
with King John, being favoured by the
Londoners, entered the City by Aldgate, which
was in a ruinous condition, and repaired, or rather
rebuilt it, in the Norman style, with an arched
opening built from the ruins of the Jews' houses,
and bulwarks of Caen stone. In the 11th
Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, the Bastard of Fauconbridge
sailed up the Thames with his fleet, he being the
admiral, to attack London in the then hopeless
interest of the Lancastrian ex-king, when the
Londoners hastily fortified the river front, and he
landed in Essex, marched to Aldgate, and forced
an entrance; but the portcullis having been
lowered, separated his forces, and they were
defeated and driven back to Mile-end, many being
slain and others dispersed. Having fallen to
decay, the gate was taken down in 1606, and
rebuilt, the finishing stone having been laid in
1609. It consisted of two three-storied square
flanking towers, with a deep recessed centre, containing
the archway and a room above, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>footway postern in one of the towers. It was
ornamented with two stone medallions, copies of
two Roman coins found on digging the
foundations, a figure of King James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, in gilt
armour, over the arch, figures of two soldiers
on the battlements, and a representation of
Fortune standing on a globe. The rooms over
the gate were appropriated to the Lord Mayor's
carver as a residence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aldersgate</span>, like Aldgate, was denominated
Eldergate by the Saxons on account of its
antiquity. It was at divers times enlarged, with
additional buildings, and was rebuilt in 1617 by
direction of the Corporation, William Parker,
merchant tailor, contributing £1,000 towards
that object. It was built with a recessed centre,
and square flanking towers four stories in height.
Over the arch was an equestrian figure of King
James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, who entered London by this gate when
he came from Scotland to succeed Elizabeth on
the throne of England, and on the opposite or
southern front were statues of the prophets
Jeremiah and Samuel, and another representation
of King James, seated in a chair of State, in his
royal robes. The rooms over the postern were
occupied by the Common Crier of the City.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This gate suffered great damage in the Fire of
1666, but was restored at the charge of the City,
during the mayoralty of Sir Samuel Stirling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludgate</span>, Geoffry of Monmouth informs us,
was built by King Lud, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 66. It was
repaired and partly reconstructed by the barons,
in 1215, out of the materials of the Jews' houses,
and was again rebuilt in 1586, when a stone was
found in the old structure bearing an inscription
in Hebrew characters, "This is the station of
Rabbi Moses, the son of the honourable Rabbi
Isaac." During some repairs in 1260, statues of
Lud, and other ancient kings, were placed upon
the gate; "but," as Stow says, "these had their
heads smitten off in the reign of Edward the
Sixth, by unadvised persons and such who judged
every image to be an idol. In the reign of
Queen Mary, they were again repaired, and had
new heads set to their old bodies." In 1586,
being much decayed, it was entirely rebuilt by
the Corporation, at a cost of £1,500, with statues
of Lud and other kings on the east, and of Queen
Elizabeth on the west. From the year 1378,
this gate was used as a prison for freemen of the
City guilty of the crimes of "debt, trespasser,
accompts and contempts." It was consumed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>the Fire of 1666, but substantially rebuilt, like
an ordinary house, with central archway and side
portions, and ornamented with statues of Queen
Elizabeth, King Lud, etc.</p>

<p>The fourth ancient gate was the exit to the
ferry across the Thames, called <span class="smcap">Dowgate</span>,
Downgate, or Dourgate, the great road to the
Kentish sea-coast, running from the opposite
bank. It seems to have disappeared, along with
the ferry, when the bridge was built and the
gateway transferred to that locality.</p>

<p>By the time of Henry <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> the exigencies of
commerce, and, as Maitland says, "the accommodation
of the citizens in repairing to their
gardens and fields," necessitated more exits
through the walls; and thus we find, as Fitzstephen
informs us, there were then seven double
gates. These Maitland conjectures to have been
Aldgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Ludgate,
Newgate, and the Tower Postern, but it seems
more probable that instead of the last-mentioned,
the seventh was Bridgegate which took the place
of Dowgate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bishopgate</span> was built by some bishop of
London; Strype supposes Erkenwald, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 675,
but Maitland thinks it was William the Norman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>in the reign of the Conqueror. There were
effigies of two bishops on the gate, conjectured to
have been Erkenwald and William, and the
presumption is that the former was the original
builder, and the latter the rebuilder; as, if
Erkenwald were the founder, the old gate would
be 400 years old in the time of William. In the
reign of Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> it was placed under the
charge of the Hanseatic Merchants of the Guildhalle
Teutonicorum, who undertook to keep it in
repair in consideration of certain privileges and
immunities, but they neglected their duty, for
which they were called to account in the reign of
Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, upon which they paid 210 marks
sterling to the Corporation for present repairs,
and entered into a covenant to be less remiss in
the future, and in the reign of Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr> they
rebuilt it. In 1561 they had again made arrangements
to rebuild it, but before the reconstruction
was commenced they were deprived of their
liberties, and the old gate remained until 1731,
when it was taken down. It was a building
of castellated character, with a pointed archway
in the centre, and posterns in the two side towers,
with statues over the central arch, and, high up
in the towers, in niches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cripplegate</span> dates from the Saxon era, and
obtained its name from the circumstance that
cripples there congregated to supplicate for alms.
Maitland considers that it, and not Aldersgate,
was one of the four original Roman gates. It is
related that, in the year 1010, during an incursion
of the Danes into East Anglia, the monks of Bury
fled to London, carrying with them the sacred
relics of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Edmund, and entering by this
gate, all the cripples crouching about it were
miraculously healed. It was sometime a City
prison for debtors and persons guilty of trespass,
and was the residence of the water-bailiff of the City.
In 1244, it was rebuilt by the Brewers' Company,
and again in 1491, Edmund Shaa, goldsmith, and
mayor in 1483, having left 400 marks for that
purpose. It was repaired and beautified, and the
foot postern new made, at the charge of the City
of London, in 1663, during the mayoralty of Sir
John Robinson, knight and baronet, and alderman
of the ward. In its last aspect it was a castellated
structure with battlements, two octangular
turrets, a recessed centre with Tudor archway,
and a side postern through one of the towers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newgate.</span>—In the reign of William <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, the
church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's was burnt, when Mauritius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Bishop of London, commenced re-edification. In
doing this he considerably enlarged the plan, and
encroached so much upon the main street which
ran through Cheapside, from Aldgate to Ludgate,
that vehicles were compelled to take circuitous
routes through narrow streets with dangerous
angles, north or south of the cathedral, to reach
Ludgate. The inconvenience became so great,
that in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, or Stephen, a new
exit was made through the wall facing Holborn,
to which there was better access from Cheapside,
and was called Newgate, in contradistinction to
the old gates. Howell, in his <cite>Londinopolis</cite>, says
that it is a mistake to suppose that it was built so
recently as the reign of Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, that it was of
much older date, and was formerly called
Chamberlaingate; and Maitland inclines to the
opinion that it, and not Ludgate, was one of the
four Roman gates, from the circumstance that
there are vestiges of a Roman road leading in
this direction. For 500 years the gate was the
common prison for felons of London and
Middlesex. In the year 1255, one John Offrem,
a prisoner, who had killed a prior, made his
escape, and Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> was so displeased that he
committed the Sheriffs to the Tower, and inflicted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>a fine upon the City of 3,000 marks. In 1422,
the executors of Sir Richard Whittington, out of
funds bequeathed for that purpose, "builded the
Gate of London called Newgate," which Grafton
says "before was a most ugly and loathsome
prison." The east side was repaired in 1630, and
the gate was entirely destroyed in the Great Fire
of London; after which it was rebuilt "with
greater magnificence than any of the gates of the
City." The new building was a lofty structure,
with battlemented roof, a recessed centre, with
pointed archway, and two five-storied sexangular
towers. It was ornamented on the west side
with Tuscan pilasters, with niches holding
statues in the inter-columniations, one of which
was a figure of Liberty, with a cat crouching
at her feet, emblematical of the career of
Whittington; and on the east were three niches
with figures of Justice, Truth, and Mercy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moorgate</span> was built in the year 1415, by
Thomas Falconer, Lord Mayor. At that time
the land outside the wall in this part was a
marsh, or moor, whence the name. It was made
for the easier access of the citizens to their
gardens and the fields beyond the marsh; and a
causeway, with dykes and bridges, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>constructed across the moor, which was improved
by Roger Acheley, Lord Mayor in 1511. Afterwards,
in the year 1606, in the mayoralty of Sir
Leonard Halliday, "the moor, before an
unhealthful place, was turned into pleasant walks
set with trees, compassed with brick walls, and
made convenient by sewers under ground for the
conveyence of the water, which cost the City
£5,000 or thereabouts." It was afterwards,
during the mayoralty of John Baker, 1733,
"new gravell'd and rail'd in a very strong and
handsome manner." The old gate, having fallen
to decay, was pulled down in 1672, and a new one
of stone erected, with a central archway, and
posterns with two stories above in the Italian
style.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridgegate</span>, which supplanted Dowgate, was
constructed along with the bridge, in the ninth or
tenth century, and was situated at the southern
end. In 1436 it fell, along with the tower above
it, and the two southernmost arches of the
bridge; and in 1471 the new gate was burnt by
the Bastard Fauconbridge. It was repaired at
divers times, and was considerably damaged by
fire in 1726, but was reinstated within two years.
As it last appeared it had a central archway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>above which was one story ornamented with the
City arms, and had two circular side towers, with
posterns for foot passengers. This gate is
historically memorable from the number of heads
of traitors and victims of royal jealousy which
have been placed upon it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in terrorem</i>. Besides
these there were several posterns between the
main gates, and many water gates, such as
Billingsgate, Wolfsgate, Botolphsgate, etc.,
which, however, were only used for commercial
purposes, as wharfs for the purpose of landing
goods from ships and barges.</p>

<p>In the great Fire of London, Ludgate,
Newgate, and Aldersgate were destroyed, and
rebuilt. In 1760-1, eight gates being no longer
necessary, and proving to be obstructions to the
traffic, were sold for what the materials would
fetch, and pulled down; Newgate was destroyed
by the Lord George Gordon rioters in 1780.
Temple Bar which was built by Sir Christopher
Wren, 1670-2, has been removed to make way
for the improvements about the new Law Courts;
it had some historical associations connected with it,
having succeeded the old gate on London Bridge
for the ghastly display of traitors' heads. It has
been carted away, very injudiciously, to be placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>in some private grounds, whilst there was one
most suitable and alone proper place for it, where
it would have retained its characteristic name,
stood in a conspicuous position, and have become
to a certain extent an ornament, and certainly an
interesting memorial of the past history of
London—that spot being on the Thames embankment,
as the river-side entrance to the Temple
Gardens.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2>Episodes in the Annals of Cheapside.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are many famous streets in the
capitals of the world—the Rue de Rivoli,
Paris; the Nevski Prospekt, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg;
the High Street, Edinburgh; the Broadway,
New York; the Joseph Platz, Vienna; the
High Street, Oxford; and the Via Sacra of Old
Rome, with many others. All these are
renowned for various characteristics of picturesque
beauty, architectural grandeur, or as the scenes
of important events in bygone times. In an
æsthetic point of view, Cheapside is inferior to
many of these, although architecturally it is now
rapidly improving, and in a few years will be able
to show ranges of buildings equal to those of any
street in the world; but of all the streets mentioned
above, excepting, perhaps, those of Edinburgh
and Rome, there is not one that can compare
with it for its historical associations, and for the
grand series of events of national and world-wide
importance which it has witnessed during the
thousand years of its existence. We purpose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>bring before the reader a few of the more striking
and picturesque of these events, which have
occurred at different periods of its history, which
will have a certain amount of value as serving to
illustrate the modes of living, the customs and
amusements, the fluctuations of opinion in politics
and religion, the relations between king and people,
and the ancient municipal glories of the citizens
of London in bygone centuries.</p>

<p>Wondrously different was the Westchepen of
the eleventh century when the Norman Conqueror
granted his brief and pithy charter to the
citizens of London, from that of the nineteenth,
with its stately edifices, its asphalted pavement,
and its rush and roar of never ceasing traffic. It
was then somewhat like an ill-tended country
road, in the summer rough and uneven and full of
deep holes, and in winter a quagmire of mud and
filth knee deep, with better beaten causeways at
the sides for pedestrian traffic. It is recorded by
Stow that in 1091, a terrible hurricane passed
over London, when 600 houses were blown down,
and the roof of the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary-le-Bow,
erected a few years previously, was lifted off,
carried some distance, and dashed into the street
with such violence that four of the rafters, twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>feet in length, were driven into the earth,
"the ground being of a moorish nature," leaving
only four feet exposed, "which were fain to be
cut even with the ground, because they could not
be plucked out." The houses stood apart from
each other like cottages in a village, and were
thatched with straw, which was the cause of
many fires, one occurring two years after the great
storm, in which nearly the whole of the remaining
houses were consumed; and so did the
citizens continue to rebuild their habitations after
each successive fire, until 1245, when it was
ordained that for the future they should be
covered with tiles or slates, instead of straw, in
the chief streets, "especially those close together,
which were but few in number, for in Cheapside
was a void place called Crown Field, from the
Crown Inn which stood at the end of it." This
field was at the end of Soper's Lane, by Bucklersbury,
and upon it were erected stages for
spectators of pageants. It was sold, 2 Ed. <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>,
to Sir Richard Cholmley, but does not appear to
have been utilized immediately for building
purposes, as we hear it spoken of in the time of
Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr></p>

<p>The curfew bell was tolled from the tower of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary, and on the top lanterns were suspended
and lighted at night, "whereby travellers to the
City might have the better sight thereof, and
not miss their ways."</p>

<p>For the supply of water there was a great
standard or conduit at the east end, where the
Poultry commences, and a smaller one opposite
Old Change, by Paul's Gate, and opposite Wood
Street stood one of the Eleanor Crosses, erected
in 1290, which having become decayed by time,
was re-edified by John Hatherley, Lord Mayor,
who added to it a fountain. These conduits were
the frequent scenes of punishments for misdeeds
and executions. Wat Tyler beheaded Sheriff
Lyon at the western standard, and there Jack
Cade chopped off the head of Lord Say; there
also Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, and treasurer
to Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, was beheaded in 1326 "by the
burgesses of London." In the same localities
also was the pillory erected, where Prynne,
Burton, and Bastwick, had their ears lopped off,
and there Defoe and a multitude of other less
known defenders of public rights and freedom of
conscience have been exposed, sometimes to the
derision, at others to the sympathy, of the mob.</p>

<p>In the Plantagenet and Tudor eras Cheapside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>had assumed a different and more street-like
aspect. Continuous lines of houses, with gables
forming a vandyke sky line, with crossed
timberings and latticed windows, ran down each
side, with the steeple of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary-le-Bow, which
had fallen in 1271, and "slain many people, men,
women, and children," and been restored gradually
until the finishing stone was placed in 1469,
standing proudly in the centre of the southern
line. At the eastern end, between Laurence
Lane and a house, called the "cage," was West
Chepe Market, the goods being exposed for sale
on stalls, which were let at 13s. 4d. the standing,
causing much bickering between the street-sellers
and the shopkeepers, in front of whose doors
they stood, and whose goods were often seized
and burnt at the standards for deficiencies in
weight, or for inferiority in quality. The
Eleanor Cross, which had been rebuilt in 1441,
and the eastern and the western conduits still
gave forth their supplies of water. The
appearance of the cross is indicated in an old
print of the procession of Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> to his
coronation in 1547; and again, with one of the
conduits, in La Serre's view of Cheapside, with
the procession of Catharine de Medicis, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Charles <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. The shops were open in front like
modern butchers' shops, and the goods exposed
for sale on bunks. Lydgate, in his "Lackpenny"
ballad, thus speaks of them:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Then to the Chepe I gan me drawn,</div>
      <div class="verse">Where much people I saw for to stand,</div>
      <div class="verse">One offered me velvet, silk, and lawn,</div>
      <div class="verse">Another he taketh me by the hand,</div>
      <div class="verse">'Here is Paris thread, the finest in the land;'</div>
      <div class="verse">I never was used to such things, indeed,</div>
      <div class="verse">And, wanting money, I could not speed."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>The 'prentices of Cheapside were a conspicuous
feature of the street at this period. During the
day they paraded up and down in front of their
masters' shop, crying "What d'ye lack; what
d'ye lack?" followed by an enumeration and
laudation of the articles within, and the wonderful
bargains to be picked up; and in the evening
listening eagerly for the sound of the curfew bell
as the signal for shutting up shop. Stow tells us
that in his time the bell-ringer was sometimes
late, and that the 'prentices, precursors of the
"Early Closing Movement" of our own time,
addressed him as follows:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Clerk of the Bow-bell, with the yellow locks,</div>
      <div class="verse">For thy late ringing thy head shall have knocks."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>The bell-ringer, knowing that they would be as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>good as their word, and deeming "discretion to
be the better part of valour," replies:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Children of Chepe, hold you all still,</div>
      <div class="verse">For you shall have Bow-bell ring at your will."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These 'prentices were a pugnacious race of
mortals, and were ever ready to issue forth at the
cry of "Clubs! clubs! 'Prentices! 'Prentices!"
leaving the shop to take care of itself, to join in
any fray that was going on in the street, especially
if it were a demonstration against a foreign
interloper in trade. They waited upon their
master and mistress at their meals, and on
Sundays and saint-days followed them demurely
to church, carrying hassocks for them to kneel
upon. In the summer evenings, after the shops
were shut and evening prayer over, as Stow tells
us, they were wont "to exercise their wasters
and bucklers, and the maidens, one of them
playing upon a timbrel, in sight of their masters
and dames, to dance for garlands hanged across
the streets," and on holidays they went out to
Finsbury Fields, and other open places, and
exercised themselves in leaping, dancing, shooting,
wrestling, casting the stone, etc., but especially
in bow and arrow practice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>Chaucer, in the <cite>Cook's Tale</cite>, thus describes the
'prentice of Cheapside:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"A prentice dwelt whilom in our cite;</div>
      <div class="verse">At every bridale would he sing and hoppe;</div>
      <div class="verse">He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe,</div>
      <div class="verse">For when ther any riding was in Chepe,</div>
      <div class="verse">Out of the shoppe thider wold he lepe,</div>
      <div class="verse">And till that he had all the sight ysein,</div>
      <div class="verse">And danced wel, he wold not come agen."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Some of the more salient features in the past
of Cheapside which present themselves to our
view in the gradual unrolling of the panorama of
the ten centuries are very varied in their
character. We behold a strange intermingling of
gorgeous processions in honour of the birth,
marriage, and coronation of royal personages,
with the pillory, the stocks, and the executioner's
block, and the accompanying lopping-off of hands,
ears, and heads, and whippings at the cart tail;
Lord Mayors' shows, generally more grotesque
than refined, and trade guild demonstrations of
splendid liveries and floating banners; combined
with 'prentices' club frays, and fights between
rival trade companies, which seldom ended
without bloodshed; tilting at the quintain;
tournaments and joustings; alongside with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>insurrectionary risings and outbursts of religious
fanaticism.</p>

<p>A.D. 1196. At this period the rich and the
noble of the land were chiefly of the Norman
race, and the poor almost all Saxons, who were
ground down to the earth by the tyranny and
oppression of their masters, to which they
submitted with a sullen dogged obedience, having
still within them that spirit of freedom which
animated the breasts of their ancestors previous
to the Norman Conquest. Richard Cœur de
Lion was king, and had just been liberated from
his captivity. He ruled the kingdom with a high
hand, and had said on one occasion, when
remonstrated with for raising money by unconstitutional
means, "Have I not a right to do
what I like with my own? I would sell London
itself if I could find a purchaser." At this
juncture up rose a lawyer, one William Fitzosbert,
otherwise called Longbeard, who seems to have
been a designing character, and desirous of
currying favour with the people, he proclaimed
himself the advocate of the poor, the redresser of
their wrongs, and the unflinching enemy of their
oppressors. He soon had a gathering around
him of the penniless and discontented serfs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>amounting eventually to 50,000 men, armed with
bows and arrows, rudely fashioned pikes, clubs,
axes, hedge stakes, and other similar weapons.
This army—or rather mob—went about offering
insults to the rich, breaking open their houses
and plundering them in broad daylight. The
Corporation had then but little authority and
power, and were not able to cope with so
formidable an insurrection; and Archbishop
Hubert, the chief justiciary, summoned the leader
to appear before him, who came, however, so
numerously attended, that it was deemed wise to
dismiss him with a rebuke. After this the
outrages of the insurgents became more barefaced
and open, as well as more numerous; whereupon
more vigorous measures were taken, and after
murdering an officer sent to apprehend him,
Fitzosbert, with a concubine and a few followers,
took refuge in the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary-le-Bow,
and fortified it against his pursuers, defying them
for some time, many persons being killed in the
assault, until at length a fire of damp straw was
lighted beneath, the smoke of which compelled
the garrison to issue forth, and after a fight in the
street, they were captured and carried to the
Tower, before the judges, who condemned them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>death. "And then," says Stow, "he (Fitzosbert)
was by the heels drawn to the Elmes in
Smithfield and there hanged with nine of his
fellows, where because his favourers came not to
deliver him, he forsook Mary's son (as he termed
Christ our Saviour), and called upon the devil to
help and deliver him. Such was the end of this
deceiver, a filthy fornicator, a secret murderer, a
pollutor of concubines, and (amongst his other
detestable acts) a false accuser of his elder
brother, who had brought him up in learning, and
done many things for his preferment." The
people, however, looked upon him as a martyr,
secured his body, carried away the broken-up
gibbet and the bloodstained earth as relics, and
reports were afterwards spread abroad of sundry
wonderful miracles which had been worked by
their sacred influence.</p>

<p>A.D. 1236. An aspect of a very different
and much more pleasing character was that
which Cheapside assumed on one occasion in this
year. King Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> had in January married
with great magnificence at Canterbury, Eleanor,
second daughter of Raymond, Earl of Provence,
and it was when she passed through the City, on
her way to Westminster to be crowned, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>civic display was made in Cheapside, which
surpassed in pomp and splendour everything
which had preceded it, and which is the earliest
of which we have any detailed account. The
street was hung with arras, silk and cloth
draperies of gay colours, and banners and pennons
floating from the housetops and windows,
accompanied by many strange devices, and
pageants on scaffolds along the route. Andrew
Bockrel, the mayor, with the sheriffs and
aldermen, and a following of 360 citizens, rode
forth to meet the king and queen, and escort
them through the City to Westminster. They
were all clad in long robes, lavishly embroidered
with gold; their other garments were of silk,
diversified in colour, and their horses were
covered with trappings reaching to the ground,
covered with embroidery and blazonry of arms.
Each man carried in his hand a gold or silver
cup, emblematic of the Lord Mayor's right to
serve the office of chief butler at the coronation
feast, and they were preceded by trumpeters.
In the evening the city was illuminated with
lamps, cressets, and other lights "without
number," Cheapside presenting a most brilliant
effect, with the bonfires blazing up from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ground, lights of different kinds gleaming from
the frontages of the houses, from end to
end of the street, and multitudes of men, with
lighted cressets on their shoulders, marching
hither and thither, and mingling with others
bearing torches, a scene infinitely more
picturesque than the commonplace gas
illuminations of the present.</p>

<p>A.D. 1249. In this year King Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>
made a raid upon the shopkeepers of Cheapside,
who, true to their instinctive abhorrence of regal
interference with their liberties, presented so
formidable an opposition to his demands that he
was fain to give way. Stow thus narrates the
occurrence: "This year the King kept his Christmas
at London, with the meanness of spirit
worthy of himself, for he begged, as it were, large
new year's gifts of the citizens. But the money
on that occasion not being deemed sufficient,
Henry soon after sent and imperiously demanded
much greater sums. This message occasioned a
great alarm amongst the citizens, who justly
complained that no regard was had to honour,
justice, conscience, nor religion; and that their
liberties, which they had so often dearly bought,
and had so many times been confirmed and sworn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>to, were not able to protect them from being treated
as the worst of the slaves; yet, notwithstanding
these great truths, they were compelled to pay the
tyrant the sum of £2,000, a very great sum at
that time. Nor did these wicked proceedings
stop here, for many shopkeepers in the City were
spoiled of their goods (especially those for the
use of the kitchen) by the order of that iniquitous
prince." We may fancy the commotion that
would be excited in Cheapside when the king's
officers appeared and seized the goods which were
displayed on the bunks for sale, and can only
wonder that the valorous 'prentices did not raise
their usual war cry, seize their clubs, and drive
the officers back with a sound thrashing to their
master who sent them. Whether they did
attempt to defend their master's property in this
their usual fashion is not recorded, but Stow
adds: "These diabolical oppressions caused
many of the most eminent citizens to retire into
the country, choosing rather to cohabit with
brutes than to dwell in the capital of so wicked a
tyrant.... Henry, being at last conscious
of his having frequently and unjustly imposed
upon the citizens of London by many heavy
and intolerable exactions, resolved to reconcile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>himself with them; and, in order thereunto,
commanded them to attend him at Westminster,
where, being assembled in the great hall, he, in
the presence of his nobility, solemnly promised
that for the future they should live happily under
his government, and not be liable to such
grievous taxations as formerly."</p>

<p>A.D. 1257. Sir Hugh Bigot, an itinerant
judge, held a court in the City, although contrary
to the ancient rights and liberties of the citizens,
and made an example in Cheapside of certain bakers
guilty of malpractices such as giving short weight
and supplying an inferior article, "by setting
them upon a tumbrell or dung-cart, wherein they
were exposed in the streets as bawds usually
were,"—a very wholesome punishment, which
might be revived with advantage in the present
day as an example to the adulterators of food.</p>

<p>A.D. 1262 and 1264. At the eastern end of
Cheapside is a street called the Old Jewry, a name
formerly applied to a limited district westward of
Lothbury, and so called from being the principal
Jews' quarter of the early race of Jews, who were
banished the kingdom <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Edward I., and
where they had a synagogue. Here they lived,
as well as about Jewin Street, and in a Jewery near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the Tower, and then, as now, made great wealth
by the practice of usury, and despoiling the
Gentiles by means of hard bargains and crafty
sharp practice in money dealings, which gave rise
to a great deal of ill-will between the two races,
much maltreatment, massacres, and unjust
demands of money from the Jews, by the kings
and other authorities, and the frequent pillaging
of their houses by mobs.</p>

<p>In 1189, a general massacre of the Jews took
place at the coronation of Richard <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, the survivors
living in constant peril of murder and confiscation,
an instance of the latter occurring in 1241, when
the Jews of London were fined 20,000 marks
because the Jews of Norwich had circumcised a
Christian child.</p>

<p>In 1262, a fierce quarrel broke out between a
Christian and a Jew, in the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Cole, in the Poultry, relative to some money
transactions, which proceeded from words to
blows, and the Jew, having dangerously wounded
his adversary, fled into the Jewry for refuge,
pursued by a mob of idlers who had witnessed the
fray, and of 'prentices from the shops, nothing loth
to join in a Jew-hunting frolic. The Jew was
captured in his own house, dragged forth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>bludgeoned to death. Not satisfied with that,
the mob fell upon the inhabitants of the quarter
and murdered them indiscriminately, afterwards
plundering and burning their houses.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards the mob was again in
arms, arising out of an attempt on the part of a
Jew to extort more than the legal interest (twopence
per week) for £20, which he had lent to a
Christian. They attacked the "Jewery" in great
force, destroyed the synagogue—the first erected
in England—massacred 500, or according to
another authority, 700 Jews, male and female,
and "spoiled the residue of their property."</p>

<p>In the Westminster Parliament of 1273, laws
were enacted to restrain their exorbitant rates of
usury, and in 1290, by an Act of the Parliament
assembled at Northampton, they were banished
the realm, and all their immovable property
confiscated. The number who were thus driven
forth amounted, according to Matthew of Westminster,
to 16,160, and thus ended the first race
of Jews in England, from which period until the
middle of the seventeenth century, although there
might be individuals, there was no organised
body of Jews in the land.</p>

<p>A.D. 1269.  In this year, the 53rd of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>reign of Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, a great fight took place
between the Goldsmiths and the Taylors
Companies, which is thus graphically described
by Fabyan: "In this lili. yere in ye moneth of
November fyll a very aulnce atweene the felys-shyppes
of Goldsmythes and Tayloures of
London, whiche grewe to makynge of parties,
so that with the Goldsmythes take partie the
felyshep or craft of—and with the Tayloures
held ye craft of Stayners; by meane of this moche
people uyghtly gaderyd in the streetes in
harneys, and at length as it were prouyded, the
thirde nyght of the sayd parties mette upon the
number of V. C. men on both sydes and ran
togyder, with such vyolence, that some were
slayne and many wounded. Then outcry was
was made that ye shyreffes, with strengthe of
other comers, came to the ryddynge of theym,
and of theym toke certayne persones and sent
them into dyvers prysons and upon the morrowe
such serche was made, yt the moste of the chief
causers of that fray were taken and put in warde.
Then vpon the Fryday followynge Saynt
Katteryn's daye, sessyons were kepte at Newgate
by the Mayre and Lawrence de Broke, iustice,
and others; where xxx. of the sayd persones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>were arregned of felony, and <abbr title="thirteen">xiii.</abbr> of theym caste
and hanged."</p>

<p>A.D. 1330. King Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> had been
murdered in Berkeley Castle, and his son,
Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, reigned in his stead, and now, five
years after the decapitation of Bishop Stapleton,
Cheapside was witness of a scene of a more
joyous character. Unsuitable as it might be
deemed nowadays, with its endless throng of
cabs, omnibuses, and other vehicles, for such a
display, it was then not unfrequently the chosen
spot for tournaments and jousts. Two years
before, the young King had married Philippa of
Hainhault, and this year she had given birth to
an infant, afterwards the famous Black Prince.
In honour of this event, and to do honour to the
visit of some French ambassadors, the King gave
orders for a tournament to be held in Cheapside.
The street was decorated with tapestries and
silver draperies, pendant on the walls, and
banners streaming from the roofs. The bright
eyes of beauteous damsels glanced in the windows
of the houses, and the street was filled with a
crowd of gaily dressed holiday-makers. The lists
were formed between Wood Street and Queen
Street, and the ground bestrewn with sand to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>prevent the horses slipping. There was
seen all the glory and paraphernalia of heraldry.
Kings-at-arms and pursuivants, decked in habits
emblazoned with arms, trumpeters, and other
officials; prancing steeds, bestridden by knights
in full panoply, with their achievements blazoned
on their shields, accompanied by their esquires
bearing their arms. Across the street had been
erected a scaffold, shaped like a tower, whereon
sat Philippa and the ladies of her court, the great
centre of attraction for the spectators in the
street below. Thirteen knights entered the lists
on each side; stalwart men and the flower of
chivalry. Their esquires handed to them their
lances, and making deep obeisance to the Queen,
they ranged themselves at each end for the
onset, when the trumpets sounded and they dashed
forward. Scarcely, however, had they done so
when the scaffold on which the Queen sat came
down with a terrific crash, which stopped the
jousters in midway. The King rushed to the
spot, anxious for the safety of the Queen, but
fortunately found that no one had been hurt
beyond a few bruises and a terrible fright. Great
confusion prevailed, and the King, in a tempest
of rage, vowed that all the careless carpenters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>who had constructed the stage should be put to
death, but the Queen, says Stow, "took great
care to save the carpenters from punishment, and
through her prayers, which she made on her
knees, she pacified the King and council, and
thereby purchased great love of the people."
After this the King caused a stone shed, called
Sildham, to be built in front of Bow Church,
"for himself, the Queen, and other estates to
stand in, there to behold the joustings and other
shows at their pleasure." It served this purpose
until the year 1410, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>,
when it was disposed of to Stephen Spilman,
William Marchford, and John Wattel, mercers,
for business purposes, with the condition that
"The kings of England and other great estates,
as well as those of foreign countries repairing to
this realm, should be entitled to make use of it
for witnessing the shows of the City, passing
through Westchepe."</p>

<p>At the western standard by Paul's Gate, Jack
Cade, the rebel leader, in 1450, caused Lord Say
to be decapitated.</p>

<p>A.D. 1382-1445. In the interval between
these dates, Cheapside was the scene of much
royal pageantry of great splendour. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Anne of Bohemia, the first Queen of Richard
<abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, entered London after her marriage, in 1382,
a castle, with towers, was erected in Cheapside,
on whose battlements stood a bevy of fair
maidens, who flung in their path counterfeit gold
coins, and threw over them, as it were, showers of
butterflies made of gold leaf; and when she and
Richard passed in procession through Cheapside,
afterwards, to celebrate his reconciliation with
the City, after a fierce quarrel, a tower was
erected, whence issued copious streams of red and
white wine for all comers, the King and Queen
quaffing draughts therefrom out of golden goblets,
and an "angel descending from a cloud crowned
them with golden circlets." In 1423 Katherine
of Valois, widow of Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, after visiting <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Paul's Cathedral, passed through Cheapside,
seated in a chair of state, with her infant king,
Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, in her lap, whence she proceeded to
Newington Manor House. Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> and his
queen—the masculine and brave, but unfortunate,
Margaret of Anjou—passed along Cheapside
with much pageantry on the occasion of their
marriage, in 1445, when they halted by the
great conduit to witness a play called <cite>The Five
Wise and the Five Foolish Virgins</cite>, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>personated with great spirit by ten City maidens.
Twenty-seven years after—in 1472—the corpse
of the weak and unfortunate monarch, after his
suspicious death in the Tower, and the fall of the
Lancaster dynasty, passed along Cheapside in
mournful funereal silence, by torchlight, and with
the face exposed, that all might see that the last
of the Lancasters was really dead, on its progress
to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, and hence to Windsor for burial.</p>

<p>A.D. 1510. Perhaps the most splendid of the
sights of Cheapside was the setting of the
Marching Watch on the Vigil of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John the
Baptist, in June, and on that of Saints Peter and
Paul in July. The City Watch was instituted in
the year 1253 by Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, and consisted of a
body of substantial citizens, with an alderman or
magistrate at their head, for each ward, to protect
the houses from robbery and the streets from
outrages by night—crimes which had hitherto
been very rife; and it was ordained that if anyone
suffered loss or violence whilst the guard was on
duty he should receive compensation from the
ward. The Marching Watch was a grand processional
display of fire and light, banners and
music, glittering armour and flashing weapons,
bonfires in the streets, and numberless cressets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>borne aloft. The citizens' wives and daughters,
apparelled in their most fascinating costumes,
occupied the windows; men and boys clambered
on the gabled roofs; whilst in the street
below tables were spread with viands and
provided by the citizens, which were presided
over by their 'prentices, attired in their blue
gowns and yellow hosen, like the Christ's
Hospital boys of our time, who invited the
passers-by—more especially if they were young
and pretty and of the other sex—to partake of
their masters' cheer.</p>

<p>On the Vigil of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John in 1510, Henry
<abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, then a frolicsome young man of nineteen,
who had only been a year on the throne, with a
companion or two, perhaps Charles Brandon,
came from Westminster, disguised as a yeomen of
the guard, to see this setting of the Watch, of
which he had heard so much. He came from
Westminster in a public wherry, and landing at
Bridewell Stairs, proceeded on foot, like a modern
Haroun al Raschid, mingling with the people and
cracking jests with them as he went along. He
stationed himself at the cross in West Cheap,
where he saw the proceedings admirably, and after
partaking, most probably, of a cake and a flagon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>of ale at some hospitable citizen's door, he
returned, so much struck with the splendour of
the festival that he vowed he would bring the
Queen (Catherine of Arragon, whom he had
married the previous year) to see it on the next
occasion, in July.</p>

<p>The Vigil of Saints Peter and Paul arrived, and
the gay monarch, faithful to his promise, and
wishing to give pleasure to his queen, dreaming
not then of divorces and the headman's axe, with
which he became so familiar in after life, brought
her in regal state and pomp, accompanied by a
crowd of nobles and court ladies, to see the civic
spectacle, which they witnessed from the hall of
the Mercers' Company in Cheapside. The street
itself, before the procession was arranged, was a
sight worth seeing, and one to be remembered for
many a long day. Huge bonfires were blazing
up in different parts; the houses were hung
with tapestry, and were lighted up with oil lamps
and "branches of iron curiously wrought,
containing hundreds of lamps, lighted at once,
which made a great show;" timber stages, hung
with variously coloured stuffs, and the latticed
windows were filled with elegantly-dressed ladies,
whose diamonds flashed in the light; banners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>and pennons floated in the evening breeze;
"every man's door was shadowed with green
birch, long fennel, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John's-wort, and such like,
garnished upon with beautiful flowers;" whilst
prancing steeds in gay trappings, armed men
with plumed casques, city and guild officials in
gay liveries and a crowd of citizens, male and
female, in the quaint costume of the period,
mingled in picturesque groups below. After
sunset the procession was arranged, and set out.
First came a band of music, followed by the
officials of the Corporation in parti-coloured
liveries, and the sword-bearer mounted on a
gaily-trapped steed, and in armour. Then came
the Mayor on a magnificent horse with housings
reaching to the earth, accompanied by a giant;
two pages, mounted; a band of morris dancers,
footmen, and three pageants. After him came
the sheriffs, similarly attended with giants,
morris dancers, and torchbearers, but with only
two pageants. Then followed a cloud of
demi-lancers, in armour, with the City arms
emblazoned on their backs and breasts; a
company of archers with their bows bent;
pikemen and halberdiers, in corslets and helmets;
and billmen, with helmets and aprons of mail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>The whole body consisted of about 2,000 men,
and between the divisions were bands of
drummers, fifers, and whifflers, and standard and
ensign bearers. Interspersed amongst them
were 940 men bearing lighted cressets—iron
frames filled with pitched rope, which blazed up
and sent forth volumes of black smoke, "which
showed at a distance like the light of a burning
city," and the same number of men to supply the
cressets with fresh supplies of fuel. Two hundred
of these were supplied by the City; 500 were
supplied at the expense of the City companies,
and the remainder were the ordinary watchmen.</p>

<p>The midsummer watch was kept up until 1539,
when Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, considering the great
expense it was to the City, caused it to be
abolished. It was revived, however, in 1548, and
continued until 1569, when in consequence of its
bringing together "abundance of rogues,
pickpockets, quarrellers, whoremongers, and drunkards,"
it was again abolished, and although some
attempts were made afterwards to restore it,
they were not successful.</p>

<p>A.D. 1485-1610. In the interval between
these dates, Cheapside was the scene of many a
grand spectacle, and it may be added of many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>so-called vindication of justice in a way of
barbarous mutilations and inhuman executions.</p>

<p>A.D. 1513. The Cheapsides 'prentices, of
whom we have spoken, were a turbulent and
unmanageable element of the community, keeping
their clubs at hand in the shops, to be ready at
any moment to rush out and join a fray, and
many a broken head they gave and got in these
fights, which generally arose, not so much out of
malice as from pure love of contention for
mastery, which then developed itself in this
rough way as it now displays itself in games of
cricket and athletic sports. There was one class
of persons, however, against whom they had a
special hatred, and nothing pleased them better
than to insult them with vile speeches, drag them
in the gutter or belabour them with their clubs.
These were the foreign merchants, importers of
silks, wine, and other commodities; the Lombard
money-lenders and stranger craftsmen and
citizens, who, they said, impoverished the
English traders and carried away the English
gold. This jealousy continued to grow, and was
brought to a crisis by a Lombard seducing a
citizen's wife, and obtaining through her, his
plate chest, and afterwards causing the citizen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>be arrested for a debt for his wife's board and
lodging during the time she was at his house.
A rumour got abroad that on the ensuing May
Day a sort of Bartholomew's massacre should
take place, and that all foreigners found in
London then would be put to death. The
'prentices now began to insult and ill-treat them
as they passed along the street, and several fled
from the city. A report of these proceedings
reached the king, and Wolsey sent for the
mayor and charged him to see that the peace
was kept in the city, which he assured the
cardinal he was quite capable of maintaining, and
departed. This was about four o'clock on the
eve of May Day, and on his return to the city he
assembled the magistrates and council, amongst
whom was Sir Thomas More, ex-under-sheriff,
when, after some discussion, it was decided to
issue an order to the citizens to have their doors
closed at nine o'clock, and to keep all their
'prentices and servants within until nine the
following morning, and the aldermen went to
their respective wards to see that this mandate,
which had been confirmed by the king and
council, was obeyed.</p>

<p>After the issuing of this order, which only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>took place about half-an-hour before nine,
Alderman Sir John Munday, on going down
Cheapside found two young fellows playing at
bucklers in the middle of the street, and a
number of other young men looking on. He
ordered them to desist and go within doors, and
upon their asking him why, instead of explaining
the order, which they had no knowledge of, he
threatened to send them to the compter, and
after a little altercation, seized one of the youths
to commit him to prison. "But," says Stow,
"the 'prentices resisted the alderman, taking the
young man from him, and cried, ''Prentices!
'prentices! clubs! clubs!' Then out of every
door came clubs and other weapons, so that the
alderman was put to flight. Then more people
arose out of every quarter, and forth came
serving-men, watermen, courtiers, and others, so
that by eleven o'clock there were in Cheap 600
or 700, and out of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Churchyard came
about 300. From all places they gathered
together and broke open the compters, took out
the prisoners committed thither for hurting the
strangers. They went also to Newgate and took
out Studley and Bets, committed for the like
cause. The mayor and sheriffs were present and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>made proclamation in the king's name, but were
not obeyed." After this they went in separate
bands, breaking open and plundering the houses
of the foreigners, until about three in the
morning, when they began to disperse, and being
thus disunited, the authorities were enabled to
capture about 300 of the rioters and place them
in prison. Sir Roger Cholmley, lieutenant of the
Tower, had come forth with a military force, "and
shot off certain pieces of ordnance against the
City, but did no great hurt." About five o'clock
the Earl of Shrewsbury and other nobles, and the
prior of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John's, Clerkenwell, came with what
forces they could get together, as did the Inns of
Court, "but before they came the business was
over."</p>

<p>A special commission of oyer and terminer was
issued to the Duke of Norfolk and other lords,
with the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and justices, to
try the prisoners. The court was held in the
Guildhall, on the 2nd of May, whither the
delinquents, to the number of 278 persons, were
brought, tied together with ropes, and escorted by
1,300 men. On the 4th, thirteen of them were
condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered,
in divers parts of the City; which sentence was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>carried out with great barbarity, in the presence
of Lord Edward Howard, "a knight marshal, who
shewed no mercie, but extreme crueltie to the
poore younglings in their execution."</p>

<p>A few days after, Lincolne, Shirwin, and Bets,
instigators of the affray, with divers others, were
dragged on hurdles to be hanged at the Standard
in Cheapside. They were placed under the
gallows with the ropes round their necks, when
a reprieve arrived. The people shouted "God
save the king," and the condemned were taken
back to prison. On the 14th, the Recorder and
some aldermen waited upon the king at
Greenwich, to solicit pardon for the rest of the
prisoners, which he bluntly refused, but ordered
them to be brought before him at Westminster on
the 22nd. On that day the king sat in state,
attended by "the cardinal and many great lords,"
and the mayor and aldermen of London. "The
king commanded that the prisoners should be
brought forth, so that in came the poore yonglings
and old false knaves, bound in ropes all along, one
after the other, in their shirts, and everie one a
halter about his necke, to the number now of
foure hundred men and eleven women. And
when all were come before the king's presence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>the cardinall sore laide to the maior and
commonaltie their negligence; and to the prisoners
he declared that they had deserved death for
their offence. Then the prisoners cried 'Mercie,
gratious lord, mercie!' Herewith the lords
altogether besought his grace of mercie, at whose
sute the king pardoned them all. Then the
cardinall gave unto them a good exhortation to
the great gladnesse of the hearers. Now when
the generall pardon was pronounced, all the
prisoners shouted at once, and altogether cast up
their halters into the hall roofe, so that the king
might perceive they were none of the discreetest
sort. Then were all the gallows within the Citie
taken downe, and many a good prayer made for
the king."</p>

<p>And thus came to an end the proceedings in
connection with the frolic of the Cheapside
'prentices, on what was long afterwards called
"Evil May Day."</p>

<p>When King John, in 1215, granted a mayor, it
was stipulated that he should present himself
before the king or his justices for approval,
whence arose the annual procession on Lord
Mayor's Day. At first it was a very simple
matter, the mayor riding on horseback accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>by the aldermen, and preceded by the
beadle and a company of minstrels. It gradually,
however, added new features, such as banner
bearers, standards emblazoned with arms,
trumpeters, "men apparelled like devils and wild
men to clear the way with squibs," "savages or
green men" with fireworks for the same purpose,
wild animals of various kinds, emblematic figures
and devices, many exceedingly quaint and
grotesque, and some with punning allusions to
the mayor. But the most conspicuous features of
the shows of the 16th and 17th centuries were
the pageants, a species of emblematical stage
representation provided by the company which
had the honour of giving the mayors. These
pageants displayed a great deal of imagination
and mechanical skill, and sometimes cost nearly a
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Sir John Norman is supposed to have been the
first mayor who went to Westminster by water,
whither he was rowed with silver oars, in 1621,
for which he was lauded in verse as "The Sun in
Aries," by Middleton, the Laureate.</p>

<p>From 1639 to 1655 the prevalence of
Puritanism and the civil war together abolished
the show, as did the Plague and the Fire from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>1664 to 1671. In 1703 the pageants were
discontinued, much to the regret of the people,
who looked upon them as the best part of the
show, and were especially delighted with some
time-honoured representations which were
repeated year by year, and never lost their
interest, such as that of the Goldsmiths, in which
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan, their patron saint, seized the devil
by his nose with the tongs, and made him roar
with pain.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this olden-time mode of
celebrating the inauguration of a new mayor, we
have selected a pageant of the Fishmongers'
Company, in the procession of Sir John Lemon,
1616, of which company he was a member. The
pageant consisted of several sections: 1. The
trade pageant, "A Fisshing Busse," ornamented
with carvings of fish and other devices, the
company's crest at the head and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter's keys
at the stern, with three fishermen aboard, one
casting the net and the others distributing live
fish among the crowd. 2. A dolphin, argent,
naisant and crowned, part of the company's arms.
"Arion, a famous musician and poet, rideth on
backe." 3. The Emperor of Morocco, in regal
costume, with crown and sceptre, "gallantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>mounted on a golden leopard, and hurling gold
and silver everywhere about him." He is
attended by six tributary Moorish kings
"carrying ingots of gold and silver and each a
dart." 4. A lemon tree, in reference to the name
of the Lord Mayor, with a pelican at the foot
feeding her young with the blood of her own
breast, emblematic of the love the chief magistrate
has for the citizens. Around sit the "five senses,
picturing flower, fruit, rind, pith, and juice."
This portion is preceded by a winged figure,
seated on a white horse, and bearing a sword,
eight men in armour bearing emblazoned banners,
and two trumpeters. 5. A man in armour, on a
white horse, carrying the head of Wat Tyler on
a spear, and five men in armour bearing
truncheons. 6. A merman and mermaid, heraldically
habited with gold chains, and riding on the
sea waves. These are the supporters of the
company's arms. 7. "The Fishmongers' Pageant
Chariot," pyramidal in form, with thirteen
allegorical figures, the upper part forming a
throne, and seated thereon a winged and crowned
figure, over which is a canopy with the Fishmongers'
crest. In front of the throne sits King
Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, in golden armour, whose life was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>preserved by Walworth, the winged figure above
being his guardian angel, who inspired Sir
William to use his dagger. There are also
numerous children seated in rows above each
other, splendidly dressed, representative of the
Royal virtues. The stages of this part of the
pageant are made to appear as if passing over the
sea waves. 8. "The Fishmongers' bower." An
arched recess with double columns, adorned with
shields of arms of former mayors of the company.
This is supposed to have been to a certain extent
a copy of the tomb of Sir William Walworth,
who lies thereon, dressed in a purple robe
trimmed with ermine, and a hat and feather,
after the style of the Jacobean period, an
anachronism considered at that time of but little
consequence. Above him stands an angel, "the
genius of London," who bids him arise from his
tomb. Forthwith he stands up, makes a
congratulatory speech to the new mayor, and then
"ridd on horsebacke with the rest of them,"
accompanied by representatives of the five
citizens who were knighted along with him for
their services against the rebels in Smithfield.
From the time when the pageants were discontinued
in 1702, the show sank down into a mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>procession, with banners, music, the companies
in their liveries, and the men in armour, as they
have come down to our day. Hogarth gives us,
in his series of <cite>Idleness and Industry</cite>, a graphic
representation of the show of 1750, with the
Prince and Princess of Wales seated under a
canopy at the end of Paternoster Row.</p>

<p>A.D. 1643. Cheapside was one of the nine
resting-places of the body of Eleanor of Castile,
Queen of Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, on its progress from
Lincolnshire to Westminster for burial, and here,
opposite Wood Street, was erected, by Master
Michael, a Canterbury mason, one of her
beautiful memorial crosses. It fell to decay, and
in 1441 was rebuilt with a conduit or fountain
connected with it, but was not completely
finished until the accession of Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr> The
fanaticism of the Puritans after the Reformation
caused them to look upon it and its statues of
Jesus Christ, the Virgin, the Apostles, and a
figure which they presumed to be, and which
probably was, the effigy of a pope, with feelings
of superstitious horror, and on several occasions
they defaced the images and otherwise mutilated
the cross. At length the reign of the Puritans
commenced, and in 1643 the Parliament decreed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>its destruction, deputing one Robert Harlow to
see it carried out. Accordingly in May of that
year he filled Cheapside with a troop of horse,
two companies of foot, and a body of workmen
with ladders, picks, crowbars, and hammers, and
as the official report informs us:—"On the 2nd of
May, 1643, the cross in Cheapside was pulled
down. At the fall of the top cross, drums beat,
trumpets blew, and multitudes of caps were
thrown in the air, and a great shout of people
with joy. The 2nd of May, the Almanack says,
was the invention of the cross, and the same day,
at night, were the leaden popes burnt in the
place where it stood, with ringing of bells and
great acclamation, and no hurt at all done in
these actions."</p>

<p>There is a print extant of the demolition of the
cross, with workmen on ladders, hammering at
the statues, and two men pulling down the finial
cross with ropes, with a surrounding of horsemen,
and beyond a body of troops with banners and
uplifted weapons. A copy of the print is given
in <cite>Old and New London</cite>, vol. i., p. 331.</p>

<p>In connection with that event a multitude of
pamphlets appeared on both sides of the question,
which may be seen in the Guildhall Library.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>From the mass we select two for notice, the
former especially as showing that the Cheapside
'prentices were then a power in the city worthy
of being courted by flattery and adulation.
Generally they adhered to the Puritanical side,
but it would appear that there were some
amongst them who held opposite views, from
their coming forth with their clubs to prevent the
demolition of the Cross; or it may be that they
looked upon their Cross as a sort of palladium;
had come to venerate it, and not being so bigoted
as some of the Puritans, did not care to see it
demolished. The title of the pamphlet runs
thus:—"The Doleful lamentation of Cheapside
Crosse: or, Old England sick of the Staggers:
Together with the hearty thanks, which I,
Jasper Crosse, hath lately returned to those
noble-minded and gentele-bred 'prentices thereabouts,
for rescuing my honour from being
ravished, especially to Robert York, who
was my chief protector at that time. London,
1641."</p>

<p>The second pamphlet, dated 1643, is entitled,
"The Downfall of Dagon; or, the Taking Downe
of Cheapside Crosse, the 2nd of May, 1643.
Wherein is contained these principalls following,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>viz.: 1. Cheapside Crosse sick at the heart.
2. His death and funerall. 3. His will, legacies,
inventory, and epitaph. 4. The reason why it
was taken down, and the authority for it.
5. The benefit and profite that is made of the
materialls of it, and the severall summes of
money which is offered for it. Likewise the
satisfaction it will give to thousands of people.
6. Notes worthy of the reader's observation that
the crosse should just happen to bee taken downe
on that day which crosses were first invented and
set up."</p>

<p>We have now brought down the annals of
Cheapside to comparatively modern and more
prosaic times.</p>

<p>We no longer see the splendid pageantry
and quaint festivities of the Norman,
Plantagenet, and Tudor eras, with their bonfires,
cresset-bearers, morrice-dancers, mummers,
allegorical pageants, and house-fronts hung with
tapestries, and other such textures. The joust,
and tournaments, the setting of the Midsummer
watch, and other curious and picturesque
spectacles, are things of the past. It is true we
still have the Lord Mayor's Show, and the
procession to Westminster, but passing along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>embankment instead of in the civic barges. We
still retain the men in armour and the old gilt
coach, and have representatives of the city
companies in olden-time costumes, and we sometimes
introduce novelties, such as a group of
elephants mounted by "Africans."</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h2>Bishopsgate Street Within and Without.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> fourteen or fifteen centuries ago what
is now Bishopsgate Street Within was a
fashionable suburb of the Roman Londinium, the
Belgravia or South Kensington of the period,
where the aristocracy and wealth of the City
located itself and built magnificent mansions after
the fashion of Rome, with columns, frescoes, and
tesselated pavements, such as we see in the
disinterred city of Pompeii. In the streets
might then be seen charioteers driving rapidly
along to contend in the chariot race; fair ladies
going to witness the gladiatorial displays in the
amphitheatre; bronzed soldiers from many a
distant province of the empire; slaves groaning
beneath heavy burdens or employed in laborious
occupations—all mixed up with the ordinary
traffic of a considerable city. Northward,
stretching eastward and westward, ran the City
wall, a portion of which may still be seen in the
street call London Wall, adorned with stately
towers and bastions, one of the latter having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>been exposed to public view by the opening of a
pathway through <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles's Churchyard. There
was, however, no gateway in this part of the
wall, as beyond lay an untraversable morass, and
beyond that a forest extending to and up the
heights of Highgate, Muswell Hill, etc., those
who wished to go northward from the city having
to go eastward to Aldgate or westward to
Aldersgate. This probably was the reason why
the rich selected this portion of the environs of
the City for their residence, as being more
retired and quiet than in the vicinity of a
thoroughfare leading to a City outlet.</p>

<p>Of these mansions of the patricians of
Londinium several vestiges have been found.
On the site of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's, the foundations of
large edifices have been laid bare. In 1707, at
the corner of Camomile Street, a fine tesselated
pavement was found; in 1752 another at the side
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's Gateway; in 1761 another in
Camomile Street; and in 1836 a splendid
specimen, in red, white, and grey, at the
north-west angle of Crosby Square, besides
fragments elsewhere.</p>

<p>This, however, was only in the later period of
the Roman rule. When they had subdued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Trinobantes, they found the capital of the
country, although a place of commercial
importance, merely a scattered collection of round
huts with trackways in the midst, extending from
Tower Hill to the Fleet River and from the
Thames to Cheapside and Cornhill, defended on
the north by earthworks, felled trees, and a
ditch; and in midst of these huts they erected
more substantial houses, with towers at the
eastern and western extremities, and probably a
temple to Diana, where <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral now
stands. The northern outskirts, now Bishopsgate
Street Within was appropriated as a burial-place,
as they never buried their dead in the midst of
the living; but in process of time the exigencies
of the increasing population demanded an
extension of the City boundaries, and they built
over the old grave-yard, making a new cemetery
on the site of the modern Bishopsgate Street
Without, Shoreditch, and the fenlands lying
eastward and westward of these. In 1576, when
digging for clay near where Christ Church,
Spitalfields, now stands, a great number of
cinerary urns were found, containing burnt
human remains, and in each a piece of coin,
wherewith to pay Charon for ferrying the defunct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>across the Styx; also, as Stow says, "divers vials
and other old-fashioned glasses most cunningly
wrought, such as I have not seen the like of, all
which had water in them, differing from spring
water" (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lachrymatories</i>), "cups and dishes of red
earthenware and three or four images of white
earth, about a span long, one of Pallas." Under
the Camomile tesselated pavement, found in
1706, lay two feet of rubbish, and beneath that
several funeral urns. Stone and timber coffins
have also been found, or rather the nails of the
latter, a quarter of a yard long, the wood having
perished, and a Roman vault in St Botolph's
Churchyard, all these, with skeletons or decayed
bones in them, indicating burial after Christianity
had become the religion of the empire, when the
custom of burning the dead was abandoned.</p>

<p>The Saxons despised the effeminacy of
decorated architecture and luxurious appliances
in the way of household furniture, hence when
they came into possession of London they
allowed the sumptuous dwellings of the Romans
to fall into decay and crumble to dust, preferring
their own rough and uncomely habitations built
of wood, but afterwards built their churches,
monasteries, and public buildings generally of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>stone, and thus Roman London passed
away.</p>

<p>The Saxons found it necessary to have another
exit from the city northward between Aldgate
and Aldersgate Street, and pierced the wall at the
end of the street running from the river, whatever
it may then have been called, and erected
there a new gate. Erkenwald, Bishop of
London, 679-97, has been credited with the work,
but as this is only based upon the discovery,
near by, of the statue of a mitred bishop, which
it was presumed represented <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Erkenwald, the
tradition may be doubted, but it was
unquestionably this supposition which gave it the
name of Bishops' Gate.</p>

<p>There are four churches in London dedicated
to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph "the Briton," all situated by
gates, Aldgate, Aldersgate, Billingsgate, and
Bishopsgate. The latter lays claim to having
been founded by the ancient British Christians,
but, more probably, was built by the Saxons and
dedicated to the British monk <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph. It
has been rebuilt no doubt several times since
then. It escaped the ravages of the fire of 1666,
but having become very much dilapidated, an Act
of Parliament was obtained at the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>last century for rebuilding it, by means of a rate
of two shillings in the pound upon all household
property in the parish, payable by the landlords,
but this proving insufficient a parish rate was
laid to supply the deficiency. It was commenced
in 1725, and re-opened in 1728, having cost (there
is nothing like precision) £10,444 1s. 8½d.</p>

<p>Tradition says that it was the burial-place of
a brother of King Lud. The present building
contains the tombs of Sir Paul Pinder; Edward
Alleyn, the founder of Dulwich College;
William, Earl of Devonshire, from whom
Devonshire Square takes its name; and in the
churchyard lies Hodges Shoughshware, "the
chiefest servant of the King of Persia, who came
from the King of Persia and died in his service,
1626, and Maghmote, his wife." The epitaph is
in Persian, and entreats that all Persians who
may read it will pray for their souls.</p>

<p>The Rev. Stephen Gorson, author of <cite>The
School of Abuse</cite>, was rector of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph.</p>

<p>The venerable church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen is situated
on the eastern side of the street, standing back
and approached by an  archway.  Popular
tradition ascribes its origin to the Emperor
Constantine in honour of his mother, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>doubtless an error, but it unquestionably dates
from the Saxon age, as in 1010 the relics of King
Edmund the Martyr were temporarily deposited
within its walls, when brought from East Anglia,
to prevent their desecration at the hands of the
Danes. In the twelfth century the advowson
appears to have been held by one Ranulph, as in
the reign of Henry <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1180, he and his
son, Robert Fitz-Ranulph, made a grant of it to
the Dean and Chapter of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral.
About half a century later, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1212, William
Fitz-William, a London goldsmith, and ancestor
of the extant Earls Fitzwilliam, founded in
connection with it a priory for nuns of the order of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Benedict, which was dedicated to the Holy
Cross and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen, the prioress on her election
to swear fealty to the Dean and Chapter, who
transferred to the priory the advowson of the
church.</p>

<p>The church seems originally to have had
simply a chancel and nave, without transepts or
aisles, but when the priory was attached, it was
duplicated by building another nave, and thus
presented the appearance of a double-aisled
church without an intermediate nave. A wall of
division ran along the middle, one of the aisles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>being appropriated to the parishioners and the
other to the nuns. It is to be feared that the
fair inmates of the nunnery were not always very
strict in their devotional exercises and seclusion
from the outer world, and were even sometimes
so naughty as to be subjected to punishments,
one of which was being shut up in the crypt,
which still exists, with the gratings, through
which they could hear the service of the church
without being present. Reginald Kentwode,
dean of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, in his periodical visitations,
found so many "defautes and excesses" that he
felt constrained to draw up a fresh code of rules
for the regulation of the house, the original of
which is amongst the Cotton MSS. in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>Willyam Basynge, Sheriff of London, 1309,
added considerably to the buildings, and came
to be regarded as the second founder.</p>

<p>The seal of the priory was an oval, representing
the Empress Helena standing by the cross (which
she found in the Holy Land and brought to
Europe) with the nails in her hand, and on the
opposite side worshippers in the act of adoration.
An impression of it is pendant from a deed in the
possession of the Leathersellers' Company, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>an engraving of it is given in Malcolm's <cite>London
Rediv.</cite>, vol. <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>, p. 548.</p>

<p>At the dissolution of the priory the site was
given to Richard Williams, one of the visitors of
the monasteries, in exchange for certain lands in
Huntingdonshire. He assumed the name of
Cromwell, being a kinsman of Cromwell, Earl of
Essex, and was ancestor of the Protector, Oliver
Cromwell. The dividing wall in the church was
taken down and the whole of the space
appropriated to the use of the parishioners. The
Leathersellers purchased the nuns' hall, and
made it the hall of their company. The priory
buildings remained, but in a ruined state, until
1799, when they were cleared away, and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Helen's Place built on the site. A view of the
ruins is given in Wilkinson's <cite>Londina Illustrata</cite>,
and a picturesque view of the church and the
Leathersellers' Hall in Malcolm's <cite>London Rediv.</cite>,
1803.</p>

<p>The church contained more "altar" tombs
with recumbent and kneeling effigies than any
other church in the City, but they suffered
terrible mutilation from the iconoclastic zeal of
the Puritans, many of them having been
altogether destroyed. Sir Thomas Gresham had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>promised to build a tower, which unhappily he was
prevented doing by death, and it was not until
1699, that it was furnished with a steeple. The
church has undergone many repairs and restorations,
notably by Inigo Jones, 1623-4, and
frequently in the plaster and whitewash style of
decoration. The last and most judicious restoration
was carried out in 1867-8, and the venerable
old church may now be seen, after weathering so
many storms, with its graceful Gothic arches, its
groupings of tombs and monuments, the nuns'
grating in the crypt, its grotesque heads, and over
one of the doors the black figure of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helena,
for which hundreds of pounds have been offered
by foreign Catholics, and refused; with many of
the same features that were looked at by the
Greshams, the Crosbys, and other old parishioners
of the Norman, Plantagenet, and Tudor ages,
with the addition of some modern stained
windows and an organ built in 1742, and rebuilt
in 1868. The rectory was sold by Queen
Elizabeth to Michael and Edward Stanhope, with
the proviso of paying a stipend of £20 per annum
to a vicar. Amongst the tombs are those of Sir
Thomas Gresham, a splendid monument; Sir
John Crosby, in full armour, and his wife, one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>the oldest remaining; Sir John Lawrence, the
noble Lord Mayor of the Plague year; Sir John
Spencer, "Rich Spencer," whose daughter and
heiress eloped with her lover, Compton, in a
baker's basket.</p>

<p><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Ethelburga is a small and very ancient
church, squeezed almost out of sight by
intervening parasitic shops; when or by whom
founded not known, but most probably in the
Saxon age. In an old print it is represented
with a spire similar to that in Langham Place.
It escaped the fire of 1666, was repaired and
"beautified" in 1694, and again in 1701. <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Ethelburga was the daughter of Ethelbert, the
first Christian king of Kent, and patron of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine; she married Eadwine, King of
Northumbria, the convert of St Paulinus, after
whose death, in battle at the hands of Penda, the
Pagan king of Mercia, she fled with her children
and Paulinus to her brother, who had succeeded
to the kingdom of Kent, and who nominated
Paulinus to the see of Rochester.</p>

<p>Walter Brune, citizen, and Rosia, his wife, in
1235, founded a priory of canons and hospital for
the sick and needy, dedicated to our blessed
Mary, called <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary Spital Without, Bishopsgate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>It was suppressed in 1539, at which time
it made up 180 beds, and supplied the sick
occupants with all necessaries at a cost of £478
per annum. Outside was the pulpit where the
famous Spital sermons were preached at Easter
before the Mayor and Corporation, and sometimes
royal personages, by the most eminent City
divines. After the dissolution they were
preached at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, then in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Bride's
Church, and now in Christ Church, Newgate
Street. The pulpit stood on a site that now forms
the north-east corner of Spital Square. There
existed for 120 years in the precincts of Bishopsgate,
near Camomile Street, a curious fraternity
called The Papey, a religious house of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John
and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Charity, sometimes called <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Augustine's
Papey, consisting of threescore priests, governed
by a master and two wardens. Its objects were
to supply the necessities of the poorer clergy by
providing them with lodgings, coals, bread, and
ale. Near by stood the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Augustine-in-the-Wall,
the patronage of which was vested
in the rich Priory of the Holy Trinity, who
presented to the living four rectors from 1321 to
1375, but after that no one could be found to
accept the incumbency in consequence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>stinginess of the Priory—the stipend not being
sufficient to live upon—who therefore in 1430
gave the church to the Papey guild. The
fraternity was not rich in funds, and in order to
improve their exchequer they practised the
singing of dirges and attended funerals as
professional mourners and dirge singers. The
house was suppressed 2 Edwd. <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr></p>

<p>From the thirteenth to the seventeenth
century a conspicuous feature in the line of
road leading northward from Bishopsgate was
the Priory of Bethlehem, with its square-towered
church, its gabled houses for the brethren and
sisters' habitations, and its gardens, situated at
the eastern edge of the moorland of Fensbury, a
little beyond <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's Church, and facing
what are now New Street and Devonshire Place.
It was then built quite in the country, with the
fens behind, fields in front, and no houses beyond
it. The roadway in front was nothing more than
a beaten trackway, almost impassable in winter,
which when houses came to be built along it, and
it assumed the semblance of a street, was called
Bedlam Gate. There is no view extant of the
priory, excepting the bird's-eye view in Aggas'
Map, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Elizabeth, where there is a continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>line of houses along Bedlam Gate and onward to
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Leonard's Church, Shoreditch, where the
road apparently terminated; eastward is the
Spittel Fyeld, with archers and cattle; and
westward, Finsburie Fyeld, with windmills,
bowmen practising at the butts, and women
spreading out linen to dry.</p>

<p>The priory was founded in 1246 by Simon
Fitz-Marie, sheriff of London in the same year,
for brethren and sisters, canons of the Order of
the Star of Bethlehem, subject to the Bishop of
Bethlehem, to whom they had to pay one mark
yearly at Easter. Their habit was a black gown
with a star embroidered on the breast. When it
became a hospital for lunatics is not known, but
there are records of sick persons being nursed
there in 1330, and of insane patients in 1403,
when six of the latter and three of the former
were maintained in the house. Weaver tells us
that at one time there was "a house for
distraught and lunaticke people" at Charing
Cross, and that some king, he did not know who,
not liking to have an establishment of people of
that class so near his palace, packed them off to
Bethlem Priory, which was probably the
beginning of its career as a hospital for the insane.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>The Hospital-Priory does not appear to have
been very amply provided with funds, as in 1403
some of the houses were alienated, for the
purpose seemingly of raising money, and the
brethren had to go abroad collecting alms for the
sustenance of the inmates. In 1523, one Stephen
Gunnings, a merchant tailor, left £40 in trust to
the Corporation for purchasing the house, to be
continued as a receptacle for lunatics, and the
Mayor took some steps for that purpose; but
before they were carried out it was granted to
the Corporation, after the Dissolution, by King
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, who placed it in charge of the
governors of Christ's Hospital in 1556, and the
following year transferred it to the governors of
Bridewell. In 1555 the income, arising chiefly
out of rents, amounted to £43 4s. 8d. per annum,
and by 1632 they were valued at £470, which,
not being all forthcoming, was inadequate for the
support of the house, and the Spital preachers
were directed to appeal to their hearers on its
behalf, there being then forty-four lunatics within
the walls, the revenues paying only two-thirds of
the cost of their maintenance. Besides, there
were so many pressing cases for admission, that
it became necessary to discharge many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>half-cured and less violent patients, to whom
were granted licences for begging, and they went
abroad, dressed fantastically, singing "mad
songs," and imploring food or money. They
went by the name of "Tom o' Bedlams," and are
alluded to by Shakespeare in <cite>King Lear</cite>, where
he says&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"With a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>In the reign of Elizabeth the church and
chapel were taken down, and houses built on the
site; and in the following century, the buildings
having become ruinous and much too small for
the constantly increasing patients, it was resolved
to build a new and larger hospital. The
Corporation made a grant of land on the southern
margin of Finsbury Moors, where the Liverpool
Street railway stations now stand, and the public
contributed £17,000 towards its erection. It
was commenced in 1644, and completed in 1676;
and in 1732 two wings were added, which made
the entire length of the building 540 feet, with a
depth of forty feet. The style adopted was that
of the Tuileries in Paris, which so offended Louis
<abbr title="the fourteenth">XIV.</abbr> that he caused some out-offices of a more
useful and less dignified character to be built in the
style of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> James's Palace, London. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>adorned with figures of raving and melancholy
madness from the chisel of Caius Cibber, which
are now in the hall of the present hospital.</p>

<p>The estates belonging to the hospital afterwards
rapidly increased in value, and at the
beginning of the present century the governors
found themselves in a position to build a larger
and better-planned building, and purchased a
large plot of land in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> George's Fields, which
with the new hospital cost £100,000. The total
income is now about £20,000 per annum.</p>

<p>Until towards the end of the last century the
insane were treated in a most barbarous way.
Nakedness, chains, scourgings, and solitary
confinement were their lot, calculated rather to
intensify than alleviate their aberration of
intellect, without any of the modern appliances of
modern asylums—music, flowers, prints, books,
amusements, cheerful society, and comparative
liberty—which are now found to be essential
towards their recovery. A good idea of the old
style of madhouse may be obtained from the
eighth plate of Hogarth's series of "The Rake's
Progress," which represents a scene in the
Moorfields Bedlam.</p>

<p>A few years ago a skeleton of a dwarf with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>fetters on the legs was dug up near Bishopsgate,
supposed to be that of a patient of Bedlam. The
road in front of the second hospital was formerly
called "Old Bethlem" and was changed to
Liverpool Street in honour of Lord Liverpool,
Prime Minister 1812-27.</p>

<p>The Hon. Artillery Company, which originated
here, removed to the present Artillery Ground in
City Road in 1622, and has numbered amongst
its officers Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, when Prince of Wales;
James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, when Duke of York, after the
Restoration; and George <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, when Prince of
Wales, as Captain in Command. The old Artillery
Ground in Bishopsgate Street has left
reminiscences of its existence in the names of
Artillery Lane, Artillery Passage, Gun Street,
and Fort Street.</p>

<p>From a very remote period has the company
of Leathersellers been connected with Bishopsgate
Street and its vicinity. In the Norman age
the tanners, curriers, and leather dressers
clustered about Cripplegate and further eastward,
where the stream of Walbrook entered the City,
that locality being the Bermondsey of the period.
The Company is supposed to have been formed
in the Saxon times, but little or nothing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>known of it until 1372, when the wardens and
seniors presented a petition to the Corporation
praying that stringent measures might be put in
force against fraudulent craftsmen who used
inferior dyes for staining their skins. They were
incorporated in 1397-8, and were re-incorporated
by Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> in 1444, with power to elect four
wardens and fifteen members of the court, and to
use a seal with arms. The charter is a
magnificent specimen of penmanship, and
beautifully illuminated. There is a picture
extant of the king presenting the charter to the
four kneeling wardens in livery dresses of red and
blue, furred at the edges, descending to the knees,
and fastened at the waist with a girdle garnished
with white metal. By this charter they were
empowered to regulate the mystery in London,
which powers were enlarged by Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr>, who
extended their supervision of the trade throughout
the kingdom. In 1604 James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> granted them a
new charter, which, like that of Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, is a
wonderfully fine specimen of art, with an
emblazonry of the company's arms and an
illumination of eight liverymen in their robes of
office—black gowns trimmed with "foins," hoods
of scarlet, and black flat caps.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>The first hall of the company was built in
1445, in the parish of All Saints' by the Wall,
south of the present Finsbury Circus, where now
stand Leathersellers Buildings. A century after
it became too small, and a portion of the site and
buildings of the dissolved priory of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen was
purchased in 1543, and the nuns' hall converted
into that of the company, which, with alterations
and embellishments, came to be for a long time
the finest livery hall in London. The ceiling was
enriched with beautiful pendants, and at the end
was a splendid Elizabethan screen, elaborately
decorated. In the courtyard was a pump with
the figure of a mermaid, from whose breast issued
wine on gala occasions. It was the work of
Cibber, who gave it in 1679, in payment of
his admission fee to the membership of the
company.</p>

<p>In 1799 the hall was sold along with other of the
priory buildings, to clear the site for the building
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's Place. A new hall was built on
the same site, but with new fittings, all the
antique decorations of the old hall having been
disposed of. This, the third hall, was destroyed
by fire in 1819, the valuable collection of records
being fortunately saved, and the present hall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>occupying the north-east corner of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's
Place, was built 1820-22.</p>

<p>The first record book of the company
commences November 12th, 1472, with the
following as the earliest entry:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Wyllyam J. Curtes gave to us this boke,</div>

      <div class="verse indent2">That God will reward hym. Amen."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are almshouses of the company in
Clarke's Court, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's; White's Alley,
Coleman Street; and Hart Street, Cripplegate.</p>

<p>Excepting the Borough High Street, perhaps no
street in London had so many famous old inns,
with galleried court-yards, cross-timbered walls,
quaint gables, and latticed windows, as Bishopsgate
Street, established for the accommodation of
carriers and travellers from the north-eastern
towns. Amongst them were the White Hart;
formerly the Magpie, which stood by the gateway
of Bethlem Priory, supposed to have been
originally the hostelry of the priory, afterwards
an inn for travellers who arrived after the gate
was shut for the night. It seems, from a date on
the wall, to have been rebuilt in 1480, and was
standing in 1810, when a view was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>representing it with a double range of bay
windows. It was again rebuilt in 1829, and stood
at the corner of Liverpool Street. The Bull,
where Burbage and his companions obtained a
patent from Queen Elizabeth for the performance
of theatricals in the quadrangle, the spectators
occupying the surrounding galleries. This was
the inn to which old Hobson, the Cambridge
carrier, resorted, from whom came the saying of
"Hobson's choice"—that or none. On a wall of
the inn was his effigy, in fresco, clutching a money
bag, with an inscription—"The fruitful mother
of a hundred more."</p>

<p>The Green Dragon, an old Tudor house. The
Catherine Wheel still a carriers' house. The
King's Head, at the corner of Spital Square.
The Wrestlers, a large inn, and the Angel, were
in existence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> The City of
London Tavern, with pillared facade, famous in
modern times for its public dinners, was converted,
in 1839, into the Wesleyan Centenary Hall,
established in commemoration of the centennial
year of the formation of the Society of
Methodists.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the street, within and
near to the gate, were certain tenements belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>to a fraternity of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, which were given
(27 Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>) to the Company of Parish Clerks
for the maintenance of two chaplains in the
Chapel of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalene, near the
Guildhall, and behind these stood the hall of the
Parish Clerks, and seven almshouses for the poor,
to one of whom was given sixteenpence and the
other six ninepence per week.</p>

<p>The Post-office, which had been in Cloak Lane,
Dowgate, was removed after the fire of 1666, to
the Black Swan, in Bishopsgate Street, whence it
was removed to Lombard Street, and subsequently
to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin-le-Grand.</p>

<p>We have noticed the palatial character of the
Bishopsgate quarter of Roman Londinum,
vestiges of its splendour having been frequently
disinterred in recent times, in attestation of the
fact. A thousand years afterwards it again
became a district of sumptuous mansions—palaces,
not of the Roman patricians, but of the merchant
princes of the modern metropolis of the world.
Most fortunately, the ravages of the great fire of
'66 only extended to the borders of the ward, and
thus have been preserved to us those precious
architectural relics of Crosby House; and the
churches of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Ethelburga. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>quaint old house of Sir Paul Pindar, has just
been taken down.</p>

<p>Sir John Crosby was born <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1420, and died
in 1475; he was a grocer (a wholesale merchant)
and woolman, and at one time Mayor of the
Staple at Calais. He was elected an alderman in
1465; served the office of sheriff in 1471, in
which year he was knighted by Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, and
represented the City in Parliament in the year
1461. He was a zealous Yorkist, in high favour
with Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, particularly distinguished
himself in the defence of the City against the
Lancastrian admiral, the Bastard of Fauconbridge,
and is introduced by Heywood, in his
drama of <cite>King Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV</abbr></cite>. In 1466 he took on
lease from the Prioress of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's certain
tenements for a period of ninety-nine years, at a
rent of £11 6s. 8d. per annum, which he demolished,
and built on the site "ye highest and fairest house
in ye citie," which he did not enjoy long, as it was
only completed four years before his death. Of
its grandeur we may form some conception from
what remains of it after the fire of 1674,
especially the great hall, fifty-four feet long,
twenty-seven and a half feet broad, and forty feet
high, with its oriel windows eleven feet in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>breadth, and extending from the floor to the
ceiling, and its timbered roof of surpassing
beauty. Around this old mansion many most
interesting historical associations have clustered.
Richard, Duke of Gloucester, inhabited it for some
time, and it figures in Shakespeare's pages as the
place where he concocted his plot for the murder
of his nephews, his marriage with his niece, which
he could not accomplish, and the usurpation of
the throne. From 1516 to 1523, it was the
abode of Sir Thomas More, where it is supposed
he wrote his <cite>Utopia</cite>.</p>

<p>It has been occupied by several aldermen, some
of whom held their mayoralty there, amongst
others, Alderman Bond, who added a turret to
the building; Sir John Spencer, who built a
large warehouse behind it; Sir Bartholomew
Read, Lord Mayor, who entertained Catherine of
Arragon for two or three days within its walls,
previous to her marriage with Prince Arthur.
The Emperor Maximilian lodged there when in
London in 1502; Queen Elizabeth came there in
1594 to witness a masque by some law students,
and the famous Countess of Pembroke made it
her residence for some time, where it is probable
Shakespeare visited her. During the Civil War
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>it was made a prison for captured Royalists, after
which the great hall was converted into a
Presbyterian chapel. In 1678 the drawing-room
and throne room were used as warehouses by the
East India Company, and afterwards as a packer's
workrooms, when they sustained a great deal of
mutilation. In 1831, it was advertised to be sold
for demolition, but some spirited persons came
forward and rescued it from that fate, besides
restoring and repairing it. From 1842 to 1860
it was a literary institute, and is now a restaurant,
the proprietor having with great good taste preserved
all the old features, and in the necessary
additional buildings has adhered to the same style.
It is supposed to have consisted originally of two
quadrangles, separated by the great hall, and that
it had a facade of 100 feet in length to Bishopsgate
Street.</p>

<p>Sir John gave 500 marks towards the restoration
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's Church, and his arms were
placed on the walls and in the windows. He was
thrice married, and had an only son, who died
without issue, the line thus becoming extinct.</p>

<p>Sir Paul Pindar was a notable merchant and
diplomatist, minister of James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> in Turkey, who
was born about the end of the sixteenth or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>beginning of the seventeenth century, and died in
1650. On his return from Turkey he brought
with him a diamond valued at £30,000, which the
king wished to purchase "on tick," but the
cautious merchant, not having sufficient confidence
in his credit, declined to let him have it on those
terms. However, he agreed to lend it to him
to flash it in the eyes of his subjects on State
occasions. He afterwards sold it to Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>,
but most probably was never paid for it. He
was reputed to have been worth a quarter of a
million sterling at one time, an enormous sum for
that period. He gave £18,000 towards the
repairs of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral, and expended
other sums on charitable and philanthropic
objects, but although so wealthy he lost so much
money in bad debts, arising out of loans to Kings
James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> and Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> that he fell into comparative
poverty, and died in debt himself.</p>

<p>He erected for his residence a magnificent
house on the western side of the street, without
the gate, a portion of whose picturesque frontal
remaining in 1890, attracted the notice and
admiration of every passer-by. It was a fine
specimen of Elizabethan architecture, and richly
decorated both without and within. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>rooms with wainscoted walls, sculptured chimney-pieces,
and ceilings profusely ornamented, but
most of them terribly mutilated; one splendid
ceiling represented the sacrifice of Isaac, with a
radiation of beautiful ornamentation. Behind
the house was a park, with mulberry trees, some
of which were only cut down within the present
century; and near by, in Halfmoon Alley, stood
a house, with sculptural details, which is supposed
to have been the gatekeeper's lodge. A small
portion with a narrow frontage was converted
into a tavern, with the sign of the Sir Paul
Pindar, which has just been taken down by the
Great Eastern Railway.</p>

<p>Devonshire House.—Built by one Jasper
Fisher, around which he laid out extensive
pleasure grounds. It was held by the Cavendishes
until 1670, but in the interval, during the
ascendency of the Puritans, had been taken
possession of by them, and made use of as a
chapel. Butler, in his <cite>Hudibras</cite>, describes the
Rump Parliament as like&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

      <div class="verse indent4">"No part of the nation</div>
      <div class="verse">But Fisher's folly congregation."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After this it was opened as a "Bank of
Credit," a sort of pawnshop, which did not last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>long, as by 1708, Devonshire Square was built,
described by Hatton as "a pretty, though very
small square, inhabited by gentry and other
merchants."</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Gresham, the wealthy and
munificent founder of the Royal Exchange, was
born <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1519; died, 1579; was knighted,
1559; married Anne, daughter of William
Fernley, and relict of William Read, and had
issue an only son, Richard, who died <abbr title="vita patris">v.p.</abbr> and <abbr title="sine prole">s.p.</abbr>
1564.</p>

<p>He was a parishioner of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's, and in
that parish he built his house, which Stow
describes as "the most spacious thereabouts,
builded of brick and timber," and that is about all
he could say in eulogy of it, for it appears, from
engravings of it, to have been more remarkable
for size than for architectural grandeur. It was
built in the Flemish style, chiefly by Flemish
workmen, and extended from the west side of
Bishopsgate Street to Broad Street. It consisted
of a quadrangle of two galleried stories, with
gabled attics; a piazza and rows of trees running
round, giving it a quiet, collegiate air, and a
picturesque aspect, and was surrounded by
gardens and pleasure grounds, with trees. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>commenced about the year 1559, and was finished
in 1562. Within its walls Sir Thomas entertained
Queen Elizabeth, and had the custody of
the Lady Mary Grey.</p>

<p>At his death he left it to his widow for life,
and at her decease in trust to the Corporation of
London and the Mercers' Company, to be
converted into a College of Professors, with
salaries of £50 per annum, to lecture weekly on
divinity, astronomy, music, law, geometry,
medicine, and rhetoric, for the gratuitous
instruction of the young citizens of London,
which were commenced in 1597. Amongst the
professors were several eminent men, one of
whom was Sir Christopher Wren, who, in
conjunction with others, there laid the foundation
of the Royal Society. The trustees allotted two
rooms to the Society, one for their meetings, the
other for their books and philosophical instruments.
Pepys tells of King Charles making
merry over the people of Gresham House, and
Boyle in particular, amusing themselves with the
child's play of weighing air. The society met at
Gresham House until 1710, when they removed
to Crane Court.</p>

<p>After the Great Fire of 1666, when nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the public buildings were destroyed, Gresham
House became the Mansion House and residence
of the Lord Mayor, the Law Courts, and the
Exchange, the merchants assembling in the
quadrangle, where they remained until their
establishments were rebuilt.</p>

<p>The collegiate lectures were not properly
appreciated, and became almost sinecures to the
professors, until in 1768-70 the Government,
wanting an excise office in the City, agreed with
the trustees to take a perpetual lease of the site,
at the absurdly low rental of £500 per annum,
the trustees to take down the buildings, to do
which cost them £1,800. The lectures were then
removed to a dull, upper room in the Exchange,
where they were delivered until the destruction
of the Exchange by fire, in 1838, when they were
given in the City of London School, until the
opening of the New Gresham Lecture Hall, in
Basinghall Street, in 1843.</p>

<p>Dashwood House stood westward of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Botolph's Churchyard, and was the City mansion
of the Dashwood family; afterwards it is
supposed to have been the residence of Lady
Jane Grey. It was subsequently converted into
the Ottoman Bank, and Consular and Mercantile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Offices; has recently been taken down, and a
colossal block constructed for suites of offices.</p>

<p>There are many other fine old houses in the
ward, dating from before the Fire, whose fronts
have been modernised by building up the space
beneath the overhanging upper floors and
removing the gables, but which retain many of
their olden time features at their backs, and are
still adorned in their interiors with fine
balustraded staircases, carved chimney pieces, and
timber-work ceilings.</p>

<p>Another house of a somewhat different but
very useful character stood in Bishopsgate Street.
In 1649 the Corporation of London founded a
house called the London Workhouse, "for the
entertainment of the greatest objects of commiseration,
but likewise to receive a great number
of the miserable and unhappy vagrant orphans
known by the infamous name of 'blackguard,' the
pest and shame of the City, pilfering and begging
about the streets by day, and lying therein,
almost naked, in all seasons of the year by night."
In 1662 a charter of incorporation was granted,
under the name of "The President (always the
Lord Mayor) and Governors of the Poor of the
City of London." In 1700 a large house was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>built for the reception of these objects of charity,
and in 1704 it is recorded that "368 children
were fed, clothed, and taught to work and the
principles of religion;" besides whom there were
"maintained and employed 653 vagabonds, sturdy
beggars, and other idle and disorderly persons."
It was taken down early in the present century,
the Poor law administration rendering it superfluous.</p>

<p>In the Parish of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's there lived and
died a man of eccentric opinions and evil
reputation, very different in character from his
neighbours, the merchant princes of Bishopsgate.
His name was Francis Bancroft, and his vocation
that of a summoning officer in the Lord Mayor's
Court, in which capacity he made a large fortune
by issuing false summonses, "not only pillaging
the poor, but likewise many of the rich, who,
rather than lose time in appearing before the said
magistrate, gave money to get rid of this
common pest of the citizens." He was so much
detested that at his funeral the populace nearly
jostled his coffin off the shoulders of the bearers,
and they set the bells ringing "for joy at his
unlamented death."</p>

<p>He entertained an eccentric notion that in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>certain number of years after his death he should
return to life and occupy his original position in
the City, and in accordance with this idea had a
vault, with folding doors and glass in the panels,
constructed in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's Church, and a coffin
with hinges only, not screwed down, so that
when he came to life he would have nothing to
do but to step out of his coffin, open the
doors of the vault, and walk out. His
name is remembered by his having bequeathed
£27,000 for the foundation of almshouses
for twenty-four poor almsmen, a chapel, a school
for one hundred poor boys, and houses for two
masters. The money was left in trust to the
Drapers' Company, who erected the buildings at
Mile-end in 1735. There was a proviso in the
will that the trustees should visit his tomb and
look upon his body, in May every year for ever,
failing which the money to be diverted to other
purposes. They have long discontinued the
custom, but still hold the trust, and although the
testator has now lain 150 years in his unfastened
coffin, he has not come forth yet to rectify this
direliction of duty on the part of the Drapers.</p>

<p>From a very early period has Bishopsgate
Street and Ward been a centre of Nonconformity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Maitland, writing 1725-36, refers to three
Presbyterian, two Independents, and one Quaker's
meeting houses in the parishes of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph and
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen. The Devonshire Square Baptist
church was, excepting one in Kent, the oldest in
England, and in its early years suffered much
from persecution. It migrated hither from
Wapping in 1638, and occupied a part of
Devonshire House, or, as it was popularly called,
Fisher's Folly. The chapel was built in 1653,
which was taken possession of by the Episcopalians
after the fire, and used for Church of
England services until the churches of London
were rebuilt. It continued to flourish until, the
Metropolitan Railway requiring the site, it was
taken down and a new Gothic chapel, with spire,
built at Stoke Newington out of the proceeds of
the sale, at a cost of £11,000. It has had several
notable ministers, the most remarkable being
William Kaffin, who made an eminent figure
among the Antipœdo-Baptists of the 17th
century.</p>

Grosvenor, D.D., a very eminent man, who held
the pastorate from 1704 to 1749, one of the most
popular preachers in London; and was also lecturer
in the Old Jewry, at the Weigh House, and at
Salters' Hall. Portrait in Dr. Williams' library.
Edmund Calamy, B.D., son of Dr. Edm.
Calamy, author of the "Nonconformist Memorial."
On the expiration of the lease in 1799, the
congregation was dispersed, and the chapel was
rented by James Relly, a rough and uncultured
Welshman, but a powerful preacher, who established
a church of Rellyanists or Rellyan
Universalists, who held a species of anti-nomian
doctrine. He was author of some controversial
works, now altogether forgotten.</p>

<p>A Presbyterian meeting-house was erected in
Little <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's in 1672, under the Indulgence,
which became a place of importance in the annals
of Nonconformity. Within its walls the first
public ordination of Nonconformist ministers took
place, and the Coward Lecture preached there from
1721, till the demolition of the chapel. There
was also a seven o'clock morning lecture, preached
every Sunday in the summer months, to
commemorate the accession of the House of
Hanover. The first minister, he who took out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the licence and collected the congregation, was
the learned and pious Samuel Annesley, LL.D.,
the ejected of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles's Cripplegate, formerly
rector of Cliffe, Kent, and of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Matthew's,
Friday Street, London, lecturer at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, and
one of the preachers at Whitehall during the
Protectorate. He was first cousin to Arthur
Annesley, Earl of Anglesey; was a popular
preacher, and author of some published sermons
and other works. He continued in the pastorate
until his death in 1694. Anne, his daughter, a
very superior woman in every respect, in piety,
intelligence, and sound discretion, was married to
the Rev. Samuel Wesley, vicar of Epworth, and
bore him nineteen children, amongst whom were
John and Charles Wesley, the founders of
Methodism.</p>

<p><abbr title="Benjamin">Benj.</abbr> Robinson occupied the pulpit from 1701
to 1724, a Derbyshire man, of great reputation, and
Merchant Lecturer at Salters' Hall. After him
the church gradually dwindled down until 1790,
when Mr. Brown preached there for two years,
and removed with his congregation to Shoreditch;
after whom Christian Frederick Trieber, with a
Lutheran congregation, occupied it for two years,
and on the expiration of the lease removed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>Cheapside. Some other ministers of various
denominations preached in the chapel for short
periods until 1799, when it was taken down and
houses built on the site.</p>

<p>In Hand Alley, on the western side of
Bishopsgate Without, stood a large Presbyterian
meeting-house. On the site had been a plague
pit, and when it was proposed to be built upon it,
the bodies, some not entirely decomposed, 2,000
in number, were carted away and buried in
another pit, over which is a passage to Rose
Alley. The chapel was built soon after
Bartholomew Day for Thomas Vincent, famous
for his labours amongst the poor during the
plague of 1665, who held the pastorate until his
death in 1678. After the fire of 1666, his chapel
was seized by the clergyman of a City parish, who
performed service there until his church was
rebuilt. After him came a succession of popular
ministers, until the beginning of the 18th
century, when the congregation, a wealthy body,
removed with their minister, Dr. John Evans,
author of "A Discourse on Temper," to a new
chapel, which they built in 1727, in New Broad
Street, when the old chapel was pulled down.</p>

<p>A Particular Baptist Church, in Great <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Helens, existed during the time of the civil war,
when the famous Hansard Knollys was the
pastor. He was a Lincolnshire man of great
oratorical talent, and gathered about him a
congregation of a thousand hearers. His
doctrines, however, were deemed irregular and
unsound by the Presbyterians, and he was
summoned before the Westminster assembly of
divines, who prohibited him from preaching.
This prohibition appears, however, to have been
withdrawn afterwards, as from 1645 to 1691, he
preached the doctrines in Curriers' Hall. He
was author of "The Smoke of the Temple," "An
Exposition of the Book of Revelations," and
some other works, including an autobiography
written in 1672. His death occurred in 1691, at
the age of 93, when he was buried in Bunhill
Fields. Portrait in Wilson's "History of the
Dissenting Church."</p>

<p>The Society of Friends have a large meeting-house
in Bishopsgate Street, which is the
head quarters of the society, where the annual
meetings are held, when Friends from all parts of
England assemble here, giving quite a picturesque
aspect to the street, when it is thronged by them
in their somewhat grotesque costume. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>first meeting-house was in Bull and Mouth
Street, Aldersgate, which was destroyed by the
fire of '66, rebuilt and occupied till 1744, when
they removed to White Hart Court, Gracechurch
Street. Many of the members of this meeting
were the originators of some of the most eminent
banking firms of Lombard Street, such as the
Gurneys, the Barclays, the Hoares, the
Hanburys, the Lloyds, the Mastermans, the
Jansons, the Osgoods, the Dimsdales, and others;
and it was from there that the remains of George
Fox were carried to Bunhill Fields for burial,
followed by 3,000 Friends. This chapel becoming
too small for the congregation, a new one, that
now existing, was erected in Bishopsgate Street
on the site of the Dolphin Inn.</p>

<p>In 1838 a Jews' synagogue was built in Great
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helens. It is the largest in London in the
Italian style, with a splendid interior.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan Centenary Hall stands in a
commanding position opposite the end of
Threadneedle Street, with a fine pedimented
range of columns.</p>

<p>We have, in our historical retrospect, seen
Bishopsgate under various aspects. In the
Roman era, when it was a suburb of aristocratic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>residences, with all the appliances of Roman
civilisation, and all the beauties of Roman art; in
the Saxon and Norman periods, with its mean
habitations and monastic establishments, with
cowled monks, and bare-footed friars, conspicuous
amongst the wayfarers as they passed along the
thoroughfare ankle deep in mud, or blinded by
the clouds of dust from the unpaved roads; in
the days of the Tudors and Stuarts, when it was
lined with picturesque gabled houses, with
overhanging upper floors, cross timberings, and
latticed windows; with quaint old hostelries and
their galleried courtyards, frequently occupied by
fashionable crowds of spectators, witnessing the
performances of the actors of the Elizabethan
drama; and with the noble mansions of the City
magnates and merchant princes. In addition to
these, there was the City gate and a conduit at
each end of the street, one to the north, just
within the gate, erected by Lord Mayor
Knesworth in 1505; the other at the south end,
at its junction with the streets of Cornhill,
Leadenhall, and Gracious Church. The street
was rendered more passable for pedestrians and
vehicles by being paved in 1543, and the sloughs
of despond, previously so characteristic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>London thoroughfares, and so impedimental to
locomotion, got rid of. After this followed the
Georgian or dark age of architecture, when the
quaint old houses of the past were replaced by
the hideous abortions of the last and beginning of
the present century.</p>

<p>Now for the third time we see Bishopsgate
Street again gradually assuming an aspect of
architectural grandeur, which will make it in
another fifty years one of the finest streets in
London or any other city. Within the last few
years there have been erected several blocks of
buildings of a palatial character, and this process
of transformation is still going on with great
rapidity. Among the more notable we may
mention the National and Provincial Bank of
England, one of the finest buildings of Modern
London; the Royal Bank Buildings, the London
and Lancashire Life Office, the Capital and
Counties Bank, the South Sea Chambers, the
Palmerston Buildings, the Devonshire Chambers,
the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the block of
offices at the rear of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's Church.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h2>Aldersgate Street and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's-le-Grand.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">These</span> two streets, forming one continuous
thoroughfare, are so intimately associated
in their annals, that it is almost impossible to
write the history of one of them without constant
reference to the other.</p>

<p>Aldersgate Street derives its name from the
old City gate which was the north-western outlet
of the City, and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's-le-Grand (formerly
Martin's Lane) from the collegiate establishment
which occupied the site of the older or eastern
portion of the Post Office. In the last century,
that portion from the Barbican to the Bars was
called "Pick-axe Street." Aldersgate is supposed
to have been one of the four gates of Roman
London, and was in the line of an ancient British
trackway, improved by the Romans into a road
called Watling Street, which came from Dover,
crossed the Thames by a ferry, passed along
where the modern Watling Street is, emerged
from the City by Aldersgate, and went onwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>towards Verulamium (<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Albans). As to the
origin of the name there are various discrepant
presumptions. Some assume that it was so
called because it was one of the elder, or one of
the four original gates; others that it obtained
its name from a Saxon—one Aldrich, the builder
or re-edifier of it; but the most probable
assumption is that it was so denominated from
the alder, or elder trees which grew in great
profusion in that locality. The wall, after
leaving Cripplegate, proceeded westward for a
short distance, then turned at a sharp angle to
the south, along the present Noble Street, until
it came to near where the Castle and Falcon
stands, where it again took a south-westerly
direction, past <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's Church and the
Greyfriars' Monastery. As represented by
Aggas's map, there were four semicircular
bastions in the Noble Street portion, looking
westward, and two in the line from Noble Street
to Greyfriars, besides the gate at the end of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Martin's Lane, which is there represented as a
heterogeneous mass of buildings, fortified, and
with two posterns, the centre arch being hidden
by a low building standing in front of it. A
little to the north-west of Cripplegate stood a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>watch-tower called the Barbican, on the north
side of the street bearing that name. It was
erected by the Romans, and was garrisoned by a
cohort of soldiers, who had a threefold duty to
perform: first to keep an outlook for approaching
enemies, secondly to watch for the outbreak of
fire in the City, and thirdly to keep a beacon
blazing on the top to serve as a guide for
travellers by night over the northern fens and
moors. Bridgewater House, which was destroyed
by fire in 1698, is supposed to have been built on
the site, and now Bridgewater Square. Some
remains of the old Barbican were to be seen here
in the last century.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the earlier history of
Aldersgate. Stow says "This gate was antiently
at divers times increased with buildings, namely
on the south side, a great frame of timber was
set up, containing many large rooms and
lodgings; and on the east side was the addition
of one large building of timber with one large
floor, paved with stone or tile, and a well therein
curbed with stone to a great depth, and rising
into the said room two stories high from the
ground."</p>

<p>In 1610, Thomas Hayes erected a conduit a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>little way to the north of the gate, which was
supplied with water brought in pipes from the
Thames.</p>

<p>It was usual to grant the rooms over the gates
as residences for officials of the Corporation,
those over Aldersgate being generally appropriated
to the city crier. There is among the
Corporation Records a deed of grant, in Latin,
dated 49, Edw. 3, 1378, which, translated, runs
thus: "Be it remembered that we, William
Walworth, Mayor of London and the Assembly
of Aldermen, with the assent of the Commonality
of the City aforesaid, by reason of the good
service by Ralph Strode, Common Countor
(pleader or common serjeant) unto us done and
hereafter to be done, have given and granted unto
the said Ralph all the dwelling houses, together
with the garden and all other appurtenances,
situate over the gate of Aldrichesgate, to have
and to hold the same as long as he, the
said Ralph, shall remain in the said office
of Countor, it being understood that the
Chamberlain for the time being during the next
year shall cause at his own expense all and
singular the defaults in the said house to be
repaired, etc." In the reign of Elizabeth it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>was occupied by the famous printer, John Day.
Frequently, as was usual with city gates,
Aldersgate presented to the view of passers-by a
ghastly garnishing of the dismembered limbs of
traitors. Thus Pepys writes, October 20th,
1660: "This afternoon, going through London
and calling at Crowe's (Alderman Crowe) the
upholsterer in Saint Bartholomew's, I saw the
limbs of some of our new traytors set upon
Aldersgate, which was a sad sight to see; and a
bloody week this and the last have been, there
being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered."</p>

<p>The gate gives the name to a City ward which
was instituted in 1285, which is divided into two
sections, each with four precincts. The first
Alderman was William de Maiener; of the
subsequent Aldermen, two have been baronets,
Sir Samuel Garrard, Lord Mayor in 1709, whose
ancestor, Sir William Garrard, was Lord Mayor
in 1555, and whose great grandson, Sir John, was
created baronet in 1621. Sir Samuel was the
fourth in the baronetcy, and left issue two sons,
both of whom succeeded, and both of whom died
unmarried, the younger in 1767, when the
baronetcy became extinct. The other was Sir John
William Anderson, Lord Mayor in 1798, created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>baronet the same year, who died without issue in
1813, when the title expired. Three Aldermen
also have been knighted, viz., Sir Peter Floyer,
Sir <abbr title="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> Halifax, and Sir Peter Laurie. The
Liberty of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's College was comprehended
in the ward, but was exempt from
its jurisdiction. Before the fire of 1666 there
were six churches in the ward, those of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John
Zachary, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary Staining, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Olave, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Leonard, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne, and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph; of these
the first five were consumed in the fire, and
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne's only rebuilt. <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph escaped
with a scorching. The most important
religious establishment in the ward was
the Collegiate Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's-le-Grand.
Tradition says that it was founded in
the time of the early British Christianity, by
Wythered, King of Kent, in honour of
Cadwallon, King of Britain. It was repaired
and endowed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1056 by two brothers
(Saxons), Ingelricus and Edward or Gerard,
which was confirmed by William <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, after the
Conquest, by charter, wherein it is declared to be
a Royal free chapel, with a collegiate establishment
consisting of a dean and a fraternity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>secular canons, with many privileges and
immunities, including exemption from outward,
civil, and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the right
of sanctuary within the limits of the liberty.</p>

<p>Ingelricus was the first dean, and after him
several distinguished men held the office, of
whom William de Wykeham, the famous
architect, Bishop of Winchester and builder
of Windsor Castle, rebuilt considerable portions
of the College; and James Stanley, brother of
the Earl of Derby, who was instituted in 1493,
and is supposed to have been the last.</p>

<p>The college with all its appurtenances was
given by Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr>, in 1502, to the Abbot and
Convent of Westminster, for the performance
of certain religious ceremonials; and on the
suppression of the abbey, 34 Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, was
transferred to the newly-created dean and chapter.
It was suppressed finally in 1548, 2 Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>,
and the same year, as Stow informs us, "the
church was pulled down, and in the east part
thereof a large wine tavern was builded, and
withall down to the west and throughout the
whole of the precinct of the college, many other
houses were builded and highly priced, letten to
strangers borne and others such as then claymed
benefitte of privileges grannted to the canons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>serving God day and night (for so be the words of
the charter of William the Conqueror) which may
hardly be wrested to artificers, buyers and sellers,
otherwise than as mentioned in the 21st of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Matthew's Gospel."</p>

<p>The curfew bell was rung nightly, at eight
o'clock, from the churchtower. Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> issued
a proclamation that "in consequence of the many
mischiefs, murders, robberies, and beating down
persons by certain Hectors walking arm in arm,
none should be so hardy as to be found wandering
in the streets after the curfew had sounded at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Martin's-le-Grand. The other churches where
the curfew bell was rung in the City were
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary-le-Bow, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles, Cripplegate, and
Allhallows Barking. At the sound of the bell
the great gates of Aldersgate were closed, but
the wickets left open, which were also shut and
fastened as soon as it ceased ringing, and were
not opened again until the morning excepting by
a special order from the Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>In digging the foundations for the Post Office
in 1818, a range of Saxon or early Norman vaults
were discovered, which had belonged to the
college, the remains of a crypt of the time of
Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, and a stone coffin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's church, situated on the western
side of Aldersgate Street, near Little Britain, is
dedicated to a Cornish monk, who is said to have
lived in the time of King Lucius, and was buried at
Boston (Botolph's town), in Lincolnshire. It is
an ancient rectory, formerly in the gift of the
dean and canons of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin, and was given
along with the college to the Abbot and Convent
of Westminster, and at the dissolution to the
Bishop of Westminster, who was suppressed by
Queen Mary, and the convent restored, to whom
it reverted. Queen Elizabeth restored it to the
new dean and chapter, who still hold it, subject to
the approval of the Bishop and Archdeacon of
London. It escaped the fire of 1666, became
ruinous, and was patched and repaired at divers
times until 1790, when it was rebuilt, a portion of
the old church being retained in the eastern wall.
It cannot be considered a handsome church
exteriorly, but the interior is effective, although
of mixed styles. It has a painted window of
Christ's agony in the garden, executed in the
dark age of glass painting. In another window,
by Jas. Pierson, the figure of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter is very
fine. Having been spared by the Fire, the
church contains a great many monuments of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>old citizens of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. There is one to Daniel Wray, <abbr title="Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr>,
Deputy Teller of the Exchequer, who died in
1783, <span xml:lang="la" lang="la"><abbr title="aetatis">æt.</abbr></span> 83. He was a learned man, and
collected a large library of old authors, which his
widow presented to the Charter House. Another,
a tablet and bust, by Roubiliac, is erected to the
memory of Elizabeth Smith, who died in 1750,
<span xml:lang="la" lang="la"><abbr title="aetatis">æt.</abbr></span> 15. There is an inscription commencing&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>At the north-east corner of Little Britain stood
an alien Cluniac Priory, or Hospital, founded in
1377, which was suppressed with other alien
houses by Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, and the endowments given
to the parishioners of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's, who founded
a brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, in connection
with the church, to celebrate masses in the
church. It was suppressed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>,
and the hall of the priory converted into a vestry
and school. There were also two brotherhoods
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Fabian and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Sebastian, and a sisterhood
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Katherine in the church.</p>

<p><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne's Church is also called the Church of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, from a tradition that it
was built by two sisters so named, and in old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>records is styled <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne in the Willows, from its
standing in a grove of those trees. The date of
its foundation is not known, but a John de
Chambrey was collated to the living in 1322.
The rectory was under the patronage of the Dean
and Canons of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's, and went with the
college to Westminster. It was destroyed by
fire in 1548, restored in 1624, again burnt in 1666,
rebuilt by Wren in 1680, when the parish of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
John Zachary was united to it, and again
"repaired and beautified" in 1701-3. Within its
walls was buried William Gregory, Mayor of
London 1451, in a chantry which he had founded.
There was a monument to Peter Helwood, who
was stabbed in Westminster Hall, in 1640, by
John James, a Dominican friar, for his zealous
prosecution of the Papists, as a justice of the
peace. The inscription says:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Reader, if not a Papist bred,</div>
      <div class="verse">Upon such ashes lightly tread."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Rev. James Penn, lecturer at the church,
was, along with the Rev. S. Aldrich, rector of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
John's, Clerkenwell, appointed to investigate the
mystery of the Cock Lane Ghost.</p>

<p>There have been several notable Nonconformist
chapels in and about Aldersgate Street. Early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>in the reign of Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, the Society of
Friends established a meeting in Bull and Mouth
Street, and George Fox frequently preached
there. As was common at that time, the
congregation was subjected to barbarous
persecution. In 1662 a mob assembled, dragged
them out into the street, beating and mauling
them severely, and killing one outright.</p>

<p>In 1760 the meeting was given up, and the room
taken by a congregation of Sandemanians from
Glovers' Hall, who held it many years until they
removed to Paul's Abbey Barbican. In 1767
appeared "A Plain and Full Account of the
Christian Practices Observed by the Church in
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's-le-Grand, etc.," which was attributed
to the Rev. John Bernard, minister of the chapel,
a learned man, and author of some other works,
who was eventually expelled from his pulpit for
"not being sufficiently humble, and for thinking
too highly of his preaching abilities." He died
in 1805.</p>

<p>Trinity Hall, at the corner of Little Britain,
was occupied by a congregation of Nonjurors,
and afterwards by a society of Moravians. It
was here that a memorable event took place,
which had an important influence in the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>revival of religion in the last century, and
resulted, along with other predisposing causes, in
the outgrowth of the now large and influential
sect of Wesleyan Methodists. John Wesley, in
his journal, May 24th, 1738, writes: "In the
evening I went very unwillingly to a society in
Aldersgate Street, where one was reading
Luther's Preface to the Romans. About a
quarter before nine, while he was describing the
changes which God makes in the heart through
faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed.
I felt I did trust in Christ alone for salvation;
and an assurance was given me that He had
taken away my sins—even <em>mine</em>—and saved <em>me</em>
from the law of sin and death."</p>

<p>Hare Court Independent Chapel was built on
ground leased for 999 years, from Sir Henry
Ashurst, in the year of the Revolution, 1688.
Originally it stood with an open space in front,
facing Aldersgate Street, with a single entrance
therefrom. It was built by a society gathered
together in the reign of Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> by the Rev.
Geo. Cockayn, who had been ejected from <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Pancras, Soper Lane, in 1662, consisting of many
of the foremost citizens and several officers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>army. It was rebuilt in 1772, with three
galleries, and a new entrance from Paul's Alley.
In 1857, the chapel was disposed of, and out of
the proceeds a new one built in Canonbury, to
which was given the time honoured name of
Hare Court, and which maintains the popularity
of its predecessor.</p>

<p>In 1804 a congregation of Calvinistic Methodists
assembled in a large room of Shaftesbury
House, under the pastorate of the Rev. T.
Madden, who removed hither with his flock from
Bartholomew Close.</p>

<p>From the time of the Plantagenets to that of
the Stuarts, Aldersgate Street was the Belgravia
of London, the place of residence of prelates and
nobles. Compared with other streets of the City,
it was spacious and open, lined with magnificent
buildings, and adorned with clusters and lines of
ancient trees. Howell, in his <cite>Londinopolis</cite>, 1657,
speaks of it as resembling a street in an Italian
city; and Malcolm, in his <cite>Londinium Redivivum</cite>,
1805, says; "Aldersgate Street is very unequal
in its buildings, but the majority are of superior
excellence, and the various shops and warehouses
of the first respectability. In width it is superior
to most of the streets within the walls of the
City."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>The only one of the famous old mansions
recently remaining was Shaftesbury or Thanet
House. It was built by Inigo Jones for the
Tuftons, Earls of Thanet, and was purchased by
Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury,
the Achitophel of Dryden. Pennant says: "It
was hired or purchased by the incendiary statesman,
Lord Shaftesbury, for the purpose of living
in the City to inflame the minds of the citizens,
among whom he used to boast he could raise
10,000 brisk boys by the holding up of his finger.
He attempted to get into the magistracy, but
being disappointed in his views and terrified at
the apprehension of the detection of a conspiracy
he had entered into against his prince, he fled, in
1683, into Holland, where he soon died of the
gout, heightened by rage and frustrated
ambition."</p>

<p>The house was afterwards let for manufacturing
purposes; in 1750 it became a Lying-in-Hospital,
which was removed to the City
Road, when it was opened as a Dispensary, with
a Dissenting Chapel, called Shaftesbury Chapel,
on the first floor, until the migration of the
congregation to a new chapel opposite Westmoreland
Buildings, called Aldersgate Chapel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>Petre, Dorchester, or London House stood on
the west side of the street nearly opposite
Shaftesbury House. It is supposed to have
been built by Sir William Petre, who became
rich by monastic plunder at the dissolution of
monasteries, and died in 1572. It was occupied by
his descendants until 1639, when it came into
possession of Henry Pierrepoint, Marquis of
Dorchester. During the Commonwealth it was
made use of as a state prison, and after the Great
Fire of 1666 had destroyed the palace of the
Bishop of London, in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Churchyard,
became the episcopal residence of the see, many
alterations being made, and the chapel built by
various bishops, and was held by them until
1725. In 1748 it was occupied by Jacob Ilive,
"the crazy printer and fanatical writer," and
twenty years after by Seddon, the eminent
cabinetmaker, ancestors of the Seddons of Gray's
Inn Road, who had the misfortune to have it
burnt, with the whole of his uninsured stock, on
two occasions. Afterwards, also, Miss Seddon
was burnt to death in the house, by her clothes
catching fire.</p>

<p>The two mighty and illustrious northern
families of Percy and Nevil had both of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>a town mansion in Aldersgate Street on the
western side—Northumberland House, on the
site of Bull and Mouth Street; and Westmoreland
House, on the site of Westmoreland Court,
extending to Bartholomew Close. On the death
of Henry, first Earl of Northumberland, at the
Battle of Bramham Moor, 1408, and his subsequent
attainder, King Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr> gave
Northumberland House to Queen Joan for a
wardrobe. Afterwards it became a printing
office, then a tavern, and finally was divided into
shops and tenements. Lauderdale House stood
on the east side, a little north of Shaftesbury
House. It was the residence of the Earl of
Lauderdale, a member of the "Cabal" ministry
of Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> Upon the site was built Bote
and Walsh's distillery. Close by Shaftesbury
House stood Bacon House, the residence of Sir
Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper to Queen
Elizabeth, and father of Lord Chancellor Bacon,
one of the greatest of our philosophers. Ralph
Montagu, third Baron and first Duke of
Montagu, "as arrant a knave as any in his time,"
as Swift observed when he was raised to a dukedom,
lived in Aldersgate Street until he built
Montagu House, Bloomsbury (the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Museum), when he removed thither. Charles
Mordaunt, third Earl of Peterborough, one of
the foremost men of the court of Queen Anne,
was also a resident. On the west side of the
street there is a picturesque old house (now a
newsagent's shop) with an inscription stating that
"This was Shakespeare's House," which may
possibly be true, but there does not appear to be
any documentary evidence in proof thereof.
Mary, Countess of Pembroke, sister of Sir P.
Sydney, the subject of Ben Jonson's famous
epitaph, which was not inscribed on her tomb,
died at her house in the street in 1621.</p>

<p>Many other distinguished personages have
been born, lived, or died in Aldersgate Street,
amongst whom may be noticed Milton, who in
1641 was living in a house at the bottom of
Lamb (now Maidenhead) Court; Brian Walton,
Bishop of Chester, the learned editor of the first
English Polyglot Bible; <abbr title="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> Flatman, the
poet, who was born in the street in 1657; the
brothers Rawlinson, who resided in London
House—Thomas, the "Tom Folio" of the <cite>Tatler</cite>,
No. 158, and Richard, LL.D., <abbr title="Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr>, and
F.S.A., both antiquaries and great collectors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>books. The Right Hon. <abbr title="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> Harley, a
memorable member of the Corporation, and M.P.
for the City, also resided here.</p>

<p>The Company of Cooks had their hall on the
western side of Aldersgate Street, adjoining
Little Britain. The company was incorporated
by Letters Patent in 1480, by Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>,
under the style and title of "The Masters and
Governors and Commonalty of the Mystery of
Cooks in London," and their charter was
confirmed by Elizabeth and James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> with "a
master, four wardens, and 25 assistants." The
hall escaped the fire of 1666, but was destroyed
by fire in 1771, and was not rebuilt.</p>

<p>There have been and still are many taverns
and hostelries of considerable note in Aldersgate
Street and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin's-le-Grand. The most
interesting is the "Mourning Bush," a very
ancient tavern with a carved ivy bush for its
sign—a timber-gabled house—with portions of the
old wall of London for its foundations. It stood
on the east side of the street, and had a back
entrance in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Anne's Lane. The landlord,
during the time of the Civil War, was a devoted
royalist, and on the execution of King Charles
had the courage to paint his ivy bush black, and
call it the "Mourning Bush." In 1749, the sign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>was changed to "The Fountain," and is referred
to by Tom Brown as one of the "four or five
topping taverns of the City," whose owners might
look for an alderman's gown. In 1830, it was
repaired and refitted, and instead of restoring the
old historically interesting name, it has since been
christened "The Lord Raglan." "The Bull and
Mouth" (a corruption of Boulogne Mouth, or
Harbour) a very ancient hostelry, originally
standing in Bull and Mouth and Angel streets,
with a galleried and gabled court-yard, now
taken down. It was rebuilt in 1830, and to
meet the more fastidious taste of the time its
somewhat vulgar name was changed to the more
euphonious "Queen's Hotel." On a stone tablet
was the following inscription:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Milo the Cretonian</div>
      <div class="verse">An ox slew with his fist,</div>
      <div class="verse">And ate it up at one meal,</div>
      <div class="verse">Ye gods, what a glorious twist!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The new branch of the Post Office is being built
on the site. Two doors from Barbican stood the
"Bell," an inn worthy of being remembered as
having been the resort of John Taylor, the
Water Poet. The Albion is celebrated for its
public dinners, and for the trade sales of London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>publishers. The Castle and Falcon is also a
famous and very old inn, standing close by, and
probably on a portion of the site of the gate.</p>

<p>Aldersgate Street has been the scene of some
incendiary fires for the sake of plunder. Pepys,
in his <cite>Diary</cite>, July, 1687, refers to a case in which
two boys, one "a son of Lady Montagu's, I know
not what Lady Montagu—got into the company of
some rogues, who persuaded them to rob their
fathers' houses of plate and other valuables, of
which they appropriated the greater portion, and
afterwards to set fire to a house in the street,
that they might abscond with the goods that were
thrown into the streets." Again in May, 1790,
some scoundrels fired a house at the corner of
Long Lane, which eventuated in the destruction
of all the houses to Catherine (? Carthusian
Street), involving the loss of property amounting
to £40,000, that they might plunder them in the
confusion. One John Flindall was apprehended,
tried, and sentenced to transportation for robbery
during the fire, when he offered to turn king's
evidence, was accepted, and he revealed the
diabolical plot, implicating especially two accomplices,
Lowe and Jobbins, the ringleaders, who
were hanged in front of the ruins. The Corporation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>took advantage of the clearance to widen
Aldersgate in this part of the street, which had
previously been very narrow, at a cost of £4,035.</p>

<p>The 7th of May, in the year 1603, was a day
long remembered by the worthy citizens of
Aldersgate Street, as that on which King James
<abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> of Scotland, entered the City through their
gate to assume the title of James the First of
England. The street was adorned with
triumphal arches; arras and costly hangings
decorated the fronts of the houses, and numberless
banners and pennons floated in the breeze
from the windows and points of the gables; the
windows were filled with the beauty of the City—matrons
and maidens; while the 'prentices and
other venturous spirits perched themselves on the
roofs, and the roadway below was densely
crowded by citizens, who ever and anon made the
welkin ring by their shouts of welcome. Sheriff
Swinnerton, with ten followers in rich liveries,
met the King at Waltham, and congratulated
him on his safe arrival. At Stamford Hill he
was met by the Lord Mayor Lee and the
aldermen, all in scarlet robes, and 500 of the most
eminent of the citizens, on horseback, all
sumptuously apparelled in velvet, with gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>chains round their necks. The procession passed
slowly along, pausing at intervals to look upon
some ingeniously-contrived pageant, and listen to
the congratulations of the characters represented,
and along Aldersgate Street to the Charter
House, where the king was magnificently
entertained by Lord Howard four days. In the
evening the street was brilliantly illuminated by
means of bonfires, cresset-bearers marching up
and down, and lights from the windows.</p>

<p>In the last and the preceding centuries Little
Britain was the great centre of the publishing
and book-selling trades, and in Aldersgate Street,
of which it is a tributary, there have lived several
eminent members thereof. John Day, the
famous printer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> and Elizabeth,
occupied rooms over the gate. He printed a
folio edition of the Bible, 1549, dedicated to
King Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>; published also the works of
Ascham, Tindal, etc., and it was at his suggestion
that Foxe wrote his <cite>Book of Martyrs</cite>, respecting
which it was said&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"He set a fox to write how martyrs runne,</div>
      <div class="verse">By death to lyfe."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Jacob Ilive, an eccentric printer, set up
his press in London House, where he printed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>several of his own fantastic writings, such as
"The speech of Mr. J. I., to his brothers, the
Master Printers, on the Utility of Printing,
1730; etc., etc." Robert Chiswell, who died in
1711, of whom Dunton, in his <cite>Life and Errors</cite>,
says, "The most eminent in his profession in the
three kingdoms, I take to be Mr. Robert
Chiswell, who well deserves the title of
Metropolitan Bookseller of England, if not of all
the world." John Hereford, whose last publication
was the Newe Testament, 1548; Nicholas
Borman; Anthony Scholcker, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vix</i> 1548, afterwards
of Ipswich; William Tilly, who published
the new Testament in 4to. in 1549; Henry
Denham, at the sign of the Bear and Ragged
Staff, Thomas Easte, at the sign of the Black
Horse, and <abbr title="Thomas">Thos.</abbr> Whitchurch, at the sign of the
Well and Two Buckets, St Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

<h2>Old Broad Street.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> ward to which this street gives its name
is unquestionably the richest in the City
of London, containing within its limits, extending
from Cornhill Ward on the south to Bishopsgate
Ward on the north, and from Bishopsgate Ward
on the east to Coleman Street Ward on the west,
some of the most wealthy and important commercial
establishments of the metropolis. Within
its boundaries are the Bank of England, and a
multitude of other high-class banks, the Royal
Exchange, the Stock Exchange, several Insurance
offices, Consulates, the South Sea House, the
Inland Revenue Office, Drapers' Hall, Merchant
Taylors' Hall, Carpenters' Hall, and an infinite
number of merchants' offices, where mercantile
transactions of incalculable magnitude take place
daily. It comprehends within its area several of
the most important commercial and financial
streets of the City—Threadneedle Street,
Lothbury, Throgmorton Street, Great Winchester
Street, Princes Street, Moorgate Street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Austin Friars, with other smaller streets, courts,
and alleys, all full of life, bustle, and active
commercial life. It comprehends six parishes—those
of Allhallows-on-the-Wall, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Martin
Outwich, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Bene't Fink, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Bartholemew-by-the-Exchange,
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter-le-Poor, and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Christopher, Threadneedle Street. Besides
these are the Dutch Church, of the Austin
Friars, and the Walloon or French Protestant
Church in Threadneedle Street.</p>

<p>Old Broad Street is a wide spacious thoroughfare
extending from the end of Throgmorton
Street to London Wall and Wormwood Street,
whence it is continued northward to Liverpool
Street by New Broad Street; at the south end,
by Throgmorton Street, it diverges at a slight
angle to the end of Threadneedle Street, this
portion having formerly been called Little Broad
Street.</p>

<p>In the time of Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> it was one of the
most fashionable streets in London, the place of
residence of several aristocratic families, including,
amongst others, those of the Earls of Shrewsbury,
the Careys, Barons Hunsdon, and Earls of
Dover, and the Westons, Barons Weston, and
Earls of Portland, extinct 1688. The most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>important house, however, was Winchester
House, which, with its gardens, occupied the site
of Great and Little Winchester streets. The
mansion was built by Sir William Paulet, first
Marquis of Winchester, one of the foremost men
of his age, and a remarkable man in many
respects. He was born in the year 1475, and
lived to the age of 97, holding various offices of
state during two-thirds of that period, and at his
death left upwards of a hundred descendants. In
1539 he was created, by patent, Baron <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John
of Basing, to which title, by writ of summons,
1299, he was eldest co-heir. In 1549 he was
created Earl of Wiltshire, and in 1551 Marquis
of Winchester. He was Comptroller of the
Household to Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, an executor of his
will, and guardian of the young king, Edward
<abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, and afterwards became Lord Treasurer, and
was made Knight of the Garter. He died in
1572, having witnessed all the changes of
religion, and the turmoils and troubles attendant
thereupon. On being asked how he managed to
maintain his position, and an unbroken flow of
prosperity, amid all the religious and political
fluctuations of his time, he replied that "he was
made of the pliable willow, not of the stubborn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>oak." He was twice married, first to Elizabeth,
daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of
London, who was mother of his heir, the second
marquis. At the dissolution of the Augustine
Friary, the house and grounds were granted by
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr> to Lord <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John, who pulled down
a portion of the friary, built a mansion which he
made his town residence, and laid out the
grounds afresh which extended to the City wall,
with a footway across, leading to Moorgate.
This footpath had gates at each end, which were
kept locked during the night, and no one allowed
to pass along it. The Marquis was also the
builder of Basing House, Wiltshire, memorable
for the siege it sustained in the subsequent civil
war.</p>

<p>In modern times Sir Astley Cooper, the
celebrated surgeon, resided in Broad Street, in a
house at the corner of the paved court leading to
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate Street, where
he held a morning <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levée</i> of City patients. His
fees, the first year he commenced, amounted to
five guineas, and it was not until the 5th that
they reached £100 and the 9th, £1,000. After
that they rose rapidly to £1,500, and one year he
received the sum of £21,000. Afterwards he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>removed to the West-End, but he found a
sensible diminution of his receipts from those
derived from the City millionaires. The abbot of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Alban's also had his town house opposite <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine's Gate. Even in the time of the
Romans, this part of the City would appear to
have been inhabited by the aristocratical section
of the community, as in 1854 a magnificent
tesselated floor, 28-feet square, was discovered,
such as must have belonged to a large and
high-class house. Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of
Hereford and Essex, in 1243, founded on a plot
of land extending westward from Broad Street,
a priory for begging Friars of the order of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine, which flourished until the dissolution,
when the house and grounds were granted to
Lord <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John and the church, appropriated by
King Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, in 1551, to "John Alasco,
and a congregation of Germans and other
strangers fled hither for the sake of religion," the
church to be called "the temple of the Lord
Jesus," and in the hands of the Germans, or
rather Dutch it still remains.</p>

<p>There is but one church in the street—<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Peter's, originally <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter the Apostle, but now
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter-the-Poor, a mean edifice, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>ungainly tower, and might well be designated
"the poor" from its poverty of architectural
merit. Maitland says that it "received the
appellation from the mean condition (as is
supposed) of the parish in ancient times. If so
that epithet may at present be justly changed to
that of rich, because of the great number of
merchants and other persons of distinction
inhabiting there." The probability seems to be
that it derived that name from its proximity to
the house of Begging Friars, who made a merit of
their poverty, and this came to be called <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Peter by the Poor Friars, to distinguish it
from <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter's, Cornhill, and others of the
name. We have no knowledge of when or by
whom it was built, but it is a very ancient
foundation, as there is documentary evidence
showing it to have been in existence in 1181.
Among the rectors of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter's have been some
notable men. Richard Holdsworth, D.D.,
educated at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> John's, Cambridge, where he won
a name for proficiency in arts and theology,
became master of Emanuel College, and vice-chancellor
of the university, who was preferred to
the rectory in 1636. He was a zealous loyalist,
and ejected from his living in 1642, his house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>plundered, and he imprisoned in the Tower. In
1645, he was nominated to the deanery of
Worcester and elected Bishop of Bristol, but
declined the dignity. He was permitted to attend
King Charles at Hampton Court and Carisbrook
Castle, but he suffered much by deprivation,
sequestration, and several imprisonments.
He died in 1649, and was buried in the church of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Peter. Benjamin Hoadley, D.D., afterwards
successively Bishop of Bangor, Hereford,
Salisbury, and Winchester, who held the living
from 1704 to 1720. He was eminent as a controversialist,
and held views which would now be
termed Rationalistic, approaching closely to Unitarianism,
which were developed especially in his
<cite>Plain Account of the Sacrament</cite>, and his <cite>Discourses
on the Terms of Acceptance</cite>. When Bishop of
Bangor, he published a sermon on "The True
Nature of the Kingdom that Christ came upon
Earth to Establish," from the text, "My kingdom
is not of this world," which gave rise to the
celebrated and long-protracted "Bangorian Controversy."
He published a multitude of works,
chiefly of a controversial character, and died in
1761.</p>

<p>John Scott, D.D., 1677-91, afterwards rector
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles-in-the-Fields, and canon of Windsor,
a learned divine, author of <cite>Cases of Conscience</cite>,
1683; <cite>Texts Cited by the Papists Examined</cite>,
1688; <cite>The Christian Life</cite>, 1683; ninth edition,
1702; and other works, which passed through
successive editions, and some translated into foreign
languages. His entire works were published in
two vols., fol., in 1718, and in six vols., 8vo., in
1826.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century Venice held the secret
and the monopoly of glass making. The works
were situated on the island of Murano, and many
attempts were made by other nations to learn the
secret, but the Venetians asserted and spread
abroad the report that it was impossible to make
glass elsewhere equal to that of Murano, even
with the same materials, the same workmen, and
the same method of working, as there was
something in the air of the island which imparted
a lucidity and lustre, rendering the glass of the
island superior to anything that could be produced
in any other part of the world.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century the
manufacture was introduced into England, and
works established in the Savoy and Crutched
Friars. Early in the following century a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>company of noblemen and courtiers, with Sir
Robert Mansell at their head, formed an
association for the manufacture of glass, and
built works for that purpose in Broad Street,
near Austin Friars. At that time it was not
deemed derogatory to the dignity of a nobleman
to engage in the glass trade. In Venice the
manufacture was held in such high esteem that
those engaged in the profession ranked as
gentlemen, and in France a decree was issued
that glass-working should not lessen the dignity
of a noble.</p>

<p>In 1615 the company employed as their
manager or steward James Howell, afterwards
Historiographer Royal to Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, whom
they sent abroad to obtain information for the
improvement of their processes, and to employ
skilful workmen. He obtained from the Lords
of Council a warrant to travel for three years, on
condition that he did not visit Rome or <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Omer,
and he started off in 1619, returning in 1621.</p>

<p>He tempted the best workmen, by a promise
of a high rate of wages, especially Signor
Antonio Miotti, from Lealand, who had been a
master manufacturer, and was reckoned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>ablest workman in Christendom, and from
Venice "two of the best gentlemen workmen
that ever blew crystal."</p>

<p>Howell was a remarkable man, and led a
somewhat varied life of vicissitude. After his
continental tour he threw up his situation, not
being able to bear the heat of the glass works,
was elected a fellow of his college, and in 1626
became secretary to the council of the North, at
York, and the next year was elected to represent
Richmond, Yorkshire, in Parliament. In 1632
he went to Denmark as secretary to a special
embassy, and on his return went to Ireland to
seek employment under Wentworth, but failed in
consequence of the recall and execution of that
nobleman. In 1640 he obtained a clerkship in
the council at Whitehall, but lost it on the
breaking out of the Civil War, and in 1643 was
committed to the Fleet for his loyal predilections,
where he remained until the death of the king.
On his release he found himself not only penniless,
but in debt. He contrived, however, to maintain
himself during the Protectorate by writing for
the press, and at the restoration was appointed
Historiographer Royal, which office he held until
his death in 1666.</p>

<p>When Monk came to London to effect the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>restoration of monarchy, he halted with his army
in Finsbury Fields, had a conference with the
Lord Mayor and aldermen, who coincided with
him in his views, which were professedly the
maintenance of a free Parliament. He quartered
his men in the Broad Street Glass House, and
passed himself into the City, amid the acclamations
of the people, to the Bull's Head, Cheapside,
where he took up his quarters. The glass works,
despite the monopoly, was not a success, the
manufacture was discontinued, and the house, or
a portion of it, taken by the Pinmakers'
Company.</p>

<p>The Pinmakers, or Pinners as they were
usually called, were neither a numerous or a rich
company. Indeed, Stow says that they met in
Plasterers' Hall originally, and in his time the
house had gone to decay, as "they were not
worth a pin." The company was formed in the
reign of James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, and was incorporated 2nd
Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> (1636). The arms presented a
crowned half figure of Queen Elizabeth, with
the motto, "Virginitas et unitas nostra
fraternitas." Towards the end of the 17th
century they held their quarterly courts of
assistants in Cutler's Hall, Cloak Lane, Dowgate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>In the Guildhall Library is preserved the
minute-book of the quarterly meetings from 1698
to 1723, some portions of which are engrossed.
It commences with a list of members in 1698;
then gives the minutes of the meetings in
succession. The chief business appears to have
been fining the members of the court 1s. for
being late, binding and unloosing apprentices, and
voting donations to the widows of members. The
company has now entirely disappeared.</p>

<p><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Augustine's passed through some strange
mutations before it finally disappeared. Originally
the home of a fraternity of begging friars, it
became the stables and outhouses of the mansion
of a nobleman. Then it was converted into a
glass factory; a soldiers' barracks for a short
time; after which it was appropriated by a City
company, and finally became a great centre of
Protestant Dissent, from whose pulpit were
enunciated principles of theology at which, in the
olden time, friars would have stood aghast. In
the reign of Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, Anthony Palmer, who
had been ejected from Bourton-on-the-Water,
and who suffered much under the Act of
Uniformity, an able and learned man, author of
<cite>The Tempestuous Soul calmed by Jesus Christ</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>and other esteemed works, collected a congregation
here, took a lease of the building, and
fitted it up with two tiers of galleries, and died
in 1678. He was followed by a long succession
of ministers who preached Calvinistic doctrines,
amongst the more notable of whom were George
Townes, M.A., who had been apprehended in the
pulpit at Bristol on a charge of having being
implicated in the "Presbyterian Plot," was
removed by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i> to King's Bench
Prison, and eventually acquitted. He suffered
much persecution, and died of the stone,
aggravated by his imprisonment, in 1685.
Richard Wavel, famous for his pulpit oratory,
who died in 1707. Joseph Hunt, D.D., a learned
divine, who occupied the pulpit 37 years. He
is highly panegyrised by Dr. Lardner for his
erudition, strength of mind, and wonderful
memory. Joseph Foster, D.D., born 1697, pastor
of Pinners' Hall Church 1774-1753, author of <cite>The
Usefulness, Truth, and Excellency of the
Christian Revelation</cite>, written in reply to
<cite>Christianity as Old as Creation</cite>. He was buried
in Bunhill Fields. Caleb Fleming, D.D., born
at Nottingham, 1698; pastor, 1753-1778, having
been previously minister of a congregation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>Bartholomew Close. Author of a multitude of
pamphlets—some published anonymously—quaint
and obscure in style. He held opinions verging
on Socinianism, and "set down as fools all who
held different opinions," including Watts,
Bradbury, Pike, Wesley, Whitefield, and
Sherlock. This congregation only occupied the
chapel in the mornings, and at the expiration of
the lease, in 1778, the church was dispersed. In
the afternoons an Independent Church, commenced
by Thomas Cole, who died in 1697,
rented the chapel. He was followed by Dr. John
Singleton, who in 1704 removed with the church
to Lorimer's Hall.</p>

<p>In that year (1704) Dr. Isaac Watts preached
here in the afternoons until 1708, when he
removed to the new meeting house in Duke's
Place.</p>

<p>Then followed, in 1708, a congregation under
the oversight of James Maisters, who came
hither from Joiners' Hall, who, with his successor
Thomas Richardson, removed in 1723
to Devonshire Square. About 1741 Mr.
Weatherley's congregation of General Baptists
came here from Artillery Place, Spitalfields,
and continued until the expiration of the lease,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>when they removed to Berry Street. A sect of
Seventh Day Baptists also occupied the chapel
on Saturdays, under the pastorate of Thomas
Bampfield, "who died a martyr in Newgate in
1684." The church afterwards removed to
Curriers' Hall.</p>

<p>In 1779 a lease was taken of the chapel by
Anthony Cole, a seceder from the Countess of
Huntingdon's connection, who gathered together
a numerous congregation, who assembled
here until the expiration of the lease in 1799,
when they removed to Founders' Hall.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the building was taken down,
and all traces of it are now obliterated.</p>

<p>But that which rendered Pinners' Hall so
conspicuous and celebrated in the annals of
Nonconformity was the establishment of the
Merchants' Lecture within its walls. In 1672,
the Dutch war commenced, and Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> and
his advisers, thinking it desirable that there should
be peace at home in the religious world whilst
there was war abroad, issued the memorable
Declaration of Indulgence, in the preamble to
which it was stated, "that there was very little
fruit of all those forcible methods which had been
used for seducing erring and dissenting persons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>etc. His Majesty therefore, by virtue of his
supreme power in matters ecclesiastical, took
upon him to suspend all penal laws about
them, declaring that he would grant a convenient
number of public meeting places to men of all
sects that did not conform, provided they took
out licences, etc." This was welcomed by the
Dissenters generally as a gracious act of toleration,
but there were those amongst them who looked
upon it as a stepping-stone to the re-introduction
of Popery. Taking advantage of the indulgence,
the Presbyterians and Independents who agreed
in the fundamental principles of the Reformation,
and in a desire to tear away from the Anglican
Church the shreds of Popery which still adhered
to it, met together, under the patronage of the
merchants of London, and agreed to establish in
Pinners' Hall a weekly lecture, to be preached on
Tuesday mornings.</p>

<p>At first four Presbyterian and two Independent
ministers, the most eminent of their day, were
appointed to preach in turn. They were Drs.
Bates, Manton, and Owen, and Messrs. Baxter,
Collins, and Jenkyn, and for a time the lectures
were continued with success and acceptance, and
with tolerable unanimity, despite some little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>bickering on the questions of Predestination and
Reprobation, occasioned by a sermon preached by
Baxter, who defended his sermon in a tract
entitled <cite>An Appeal to the Light</cite>, when Dr.
Manton came forward and partially suppressed
the clamour, but Baxter seceded.</p>

<p>A succession of distinguished ministers continued
the lecture until 1694, when the Calvinistic
question again cropped up, arising out of the
reprinting of the works of Dr. Tobias Crisp,
which were published under the editorship of his
son in 1690, and written against by Mr. Williams,
one of the lecturers. Discord sprung up, and an
attempt was made to exclude him from the lectureship,
upon which four of the lecturers,—Dr. Bates,
and Messrs. Williams, Howe, and Alsop,—sent in
their resignations, and set up an opposition
lecture at Salters' Hall, at the same day and
hour.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the lease the lecture was
removed to Little <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen's, and afterwards to
the chapel in New Broad Street, about 1780, but
was very thinly attended.</p>

<p>The Independent Chapel in New Broad Street,
to which the Merchants' lecture migrated, was
built in 1728, for Dr. Guyse and a congregation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>who separated with him from Miles Lane. Dr.
Guyse was a learned man and Merchant lecturer
at Pinners' Hall, and was author of <cite>A Paraphrase
on the New Testament</cite>, 1739, a voluminous and
valuable work, as well as of some other works.</p>

<p>He was followed by John Stafford, D.D., who
died in 1800, and was buried in Bunhill-fields;
author of <cite>The Scripture Doctrine of Sin and
Grace</cite>, <cite>Twenty-five Sermons on the Seventh
Chapter Romans</cite>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i></p>

<p>A writer in Knight's <cite>London</cite> says: "If a
stranger from any part of England, Scotland, or
Ireland, however remote, were to pause in the
midst of Broad Street, and enquire to what
purpose that large pile of buildings opposite to
him were appropriated, he would, ten to one, on
learning that it was the Excise Office, have a
livelier idea of the operations of the Board of
Revenue, which has its seat there, than the
inhabitant of London, provided that neither had
been brought into direct contact with its officers
by the nature of his business." In 1626, King
Charles <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> attempted to introduce the excise, but
a unanimous vote of the Houses of Parliament
compelled him to renounce the scheme. Nevertheless,
in 1643, Parliament itself levied an excise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>for the maintenance of the forces raised by them;
the first articles on which the duty was laid were
ale, beer, cider, and perry. The Commissioners
of Excise sat in Haberdashers' Hall. An account
of its establishment was given by Prynne, in a
tract published in 1654, entitled, "A Declaration
and Protestation against the Illegal and Detestable
and oft-contemned New Tax and
Extortion of Excise in General, and for Hops, a
native and uncertain commodity in particular."
An excise office was built in Smithfield, which
was burnt down by the populace, and many riots
took place in London in opposition to the tax,
especially when salt and meat and other of the
common necessaries of life were subjected to it;
and a multitude of pamphlets, some of a very
scurrilous character, appeared in opposition to it.
The Excise office was afterwards removed to the
mansion of Sir J. Frederick, in Ironmonger Lane,
and remained there until 1768, when the trustees
of the Gresham estates let the ground on which
Gresham College and Almshouses stood, extending
from Bishopsgate Street to Broad Street,
to Government for £500 per annum, the City and
Mercers' Company further agreeing to pay out of
the Gresham funds the sum of £1,800 towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>the demolition of the college and the building of
the Excise Office. The architect was the elder
Dance, who erected a plain but spacious and
commanding looking brick building, which served
the purpose of the commissioners until 1848,
when the office was removed to Somerset House.</p>

<p>That portion of the grounds of the Gresham
estate which faced Broad Street, was occupied by
the almshouses founded by Sir Thomas Gresham
in 1575, and bequeathed by him in trust to the
Lord Mayor and Commonalty of the City of
London. They consisted of eight tenements for
eight poor men, with an annual allowance of £6
13s. 4d. and a load of coals, and a new gown
every two years. On their demolition to make
room for the Excise Office, they were removed to
the City green-yard, in Whitecross Street.</p>

<p>Another Government office which stood in
Broad Street was the Pay Office for the Navy.
It was situated in a portion of Winchester House
at the north-west corner of Great Winchester
Street, has since been removed, and is now
located in Somerset House.</p>

<p>The South Sea House formerly extended from
Threadneedle Street to Broad Street, with a
frontage in both streets; now it is confined to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>former street in a more modern building. The
company was incorporated in 1710 by Queen
Anne, for the purpose of paying off a sum of ten
millions due to the seamen who had been engaged
in the French wars. In 1720 they obtained an
Act of Parliament giving them a monopoly of
trading to the South Seas. By a series of
iniquitous frauds and deceptions they raised the
shares to a fictitious value of 1,000 per cent., and
caused the nation to fall into a sort of financial
madness in their eagerness to get shares, which
resulted in the "South Sea Bubble." The panic
on its bursting caused the ruin of innumerable
families, whilst a few clever rogues realised large
fortunes. The company has long ceased to be a
trading body, and the remnant of the stock,
converted into annuity stock, is managed by
Government, under the provisions of an Act of
Parliament passed in 1753.</p>

<p>The district northward of Old Broad Street
was formerly called Petty France, on which New
Broad Street has been built. Seymoor in his
edition of Stow writes: "Petty France; the
greatest part of this is new built, and called New
Broad Street. It is a most regular building; the
houses are after the manner of those by Hanover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Square and Burlington Gardens, and are the
most elegant buildings in the City."</p>

<p>In New Broad Street, besides the Independent
Chapel, mentioned <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">supra</i>, a Presbyterian chapel
was erected in 1729, for a congregation which
removed hither from Hand Alley, Bishopsgate,
where a Church had been formed early in the
reign of Charles <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> by Thomas Vincent, who
rendered himself famous by his labours amongst
the sick during the Plague. Dr. John Evans, a
pious and eminent man, was minister of the
Church at the time of the removal, and was
author of a great number of published sermons,
and other works, including "Two sermons
preached at the opening of a new meeting place,
in New Broad Street, Petty France, December
14th and 21st, 1730." John Allen, M.D., was a
subsequent minister of the chapel, author of
several sermons which were printed; and another
was John Palmer, a controversial writer, and
opponent of Dr. Priestley. At the expiration of
the lease in 1780 the chapel was taken down and
the church dispersed.</p>

<p>An illustration of the primitive mode of
stopping the ravages of fire occurred in 1314,
when permission was asked by the officials of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>Broad Street ward to cut down an elm tree
standing by London Wall and sell it, to enable
them to purchase a new cord for their
"wardhoke," a hook which was kept in each
ward of the City for the purpose of pulling
down houses to prevent the spreading of fires.</p>

<p>In 1500 an inquisition was held to ascertain
the liability of the ward to maintain two bridges
over the Wall Brook running from "Vynesbury,"
now broken, and to replace the hinges of
Bishopsgate, when it was found that the Prior of
Holy Trinity was bound by his charter to keep
one of the bridges in repair, and the Prior of the
New Hospital without Bishopsgate and Broad
Street ward the other jointly, and that it
devolved on the Bishop of London to maintain the
hinges of the gate, as he claimed a stick from every
load of wood that passed through the gateway.</p>

<p>Broad Street of late years has become a
thoroughfare of immense traffic, especially in the
mornings and evenings, of cabs and pedestrians
going from and to the half-dozen railways which
have erected stations and termini in Liverpool
Street, so much so as to render it at certain times
of the day one of the most thronged streets of
the City.</p>

<h2>Chaucer and the Tabard.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Tabard has passed away! Another of
the relics of old London—a link between
the picturesque past and the prosaic present—rich
as it was in remembrances associated with the
birthtime of English poetry, is now a thing of the
past. We have but few of these relics of Bygone
London remaining; it is true the Tower, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
John's Gate, and the house of Sir John Crosby still
linger with us; but who knows how soon the site
of the Tower will be wanted for a railway
station, the gateway of the old knights be found
to be an obstruction in the way of Pickford's vans,
and the old Bishopsgate Street house swept
away by the broom of "improvement?"</p>

<p>If there be one spot within the bounds of
London that may be especially termed classic—which
may be looked upon as sacred to poetry—that
spot is Southwark, despite its hop
warehouses, in the midst of which stood the
Tabard. The legend of the ferryman's daughter
and the foundation of the monastery and church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary Overies is redolent of romance. In
Clink Street, Shakespeare lived and wrote, and in
the theatre on Bankside he gave utterance to his
inspired imaginings; in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Saviour's Church
sleeps Gower, the contemporary of Chaucer; and
in one grave repose Fletcher and Massinger;
whilst on Bankside, in twin fraternity, dwelt
Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>

<p>More than to others should this spot and the
Tabard be dear to the citizens of London, for he
to whose shrine pilgrims of the hostelry were
wending their way was the son of a London
merchant; and he who describes, and has
rendered immortal, that riding to Canterbury, in
April of the year of grace, 1383, was born within
the walls of the City.</p>

<p>The Tabard owed its origin to the Abbey of
Newere Mynstre, Winchester, which was
founded by King Alfred, and afterwards removed
outside the walls, when it assumed the name of
Hyde Abbey, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> Alwyn, the
eighth abbot, was uncle to King Harold, and
fought, with twelve of his monks, under his
standard at Hastings. In process of time the
Abbey waxed rich, and in 1307 the Abbot
purchased a plot of land near the palace of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>Bishop of Winchester, and thereon, as Stow
informs us, "built a faire house for him and his
train when he came to the City to Parliament."
At this spot was a convergence of roads from the
southern and western counties, from whence
started eastward "The Pilgrim's Road" to
Canterbury, in consequence of which the Abbot
built, in close contiguity, a hostelry for the
reception of pilgrims, where they might repose
until a sufficient number was gathered together
to proceed in company for protection from the
dangers of the road. It was built in the
picturesque style of the period, with gables to
the street, cross timberings and latticed windows;
in the interior was a large courtyard, with
balustraded galleries running round it, leading to
dormitories; and there was a "Pilgrims' Hall," a
large room some 45 feet in length, with open
fireplaces and long tables, at which the pilgrims
dined and supped during their sojourn. At the
dissolution, 1538, it was sold, along with the
Abbot's House, and is described as "The Tabard
of the Monastery of Hyde, and the Abbot's place,
with the stables and gardens belonging thereunto."
Still, however, it retained its character
of an inn, and in the reign of Elizabeth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>repaired and partially rebuilt by "Master J.
Preston." A view of it, as it then appeared, is
given in Urry's edition of Chaucer, 1721,
representing it in the old timbered and gabled
style, with a beam stretching across the road,
from which the swinging and creaking sign was
pendant, and on which was an inscription,—"This
is the Inn where Sir Jeffry Chaucer and
the nine-and-twenty pilgrims lay on their journey
to Canterbury, anno 1383." In 1673, in
pursuance of an Act of Parliament, this cross
beam, with its supporting posts, was taken down,
but the inscription, after the rebuilding, was
painted over the gateway, where it remained
until 1813, when it was erased.</p>

<p>The street front of the inn was consumed in
the great fire of Southwark, 1676, along with
600 other houses, but was immediately rebuilt,
presumably in facsimile of the original, with its
courtyard, galleries, pilgrims' hall, and quaint old
sleeping-rooms, and it is possible that some parts
which escaped the fire may have been a portion
of the Tabard, where Chaucer sat as "a
chiel takin' notes," and where the pretty prioress,
the wife of Bath, the knight and the squire, and
the Sumpnour and the Pardoner chatted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>laughed and flirted; certainly the courtyard was
the identical spot where the merry party mounted
their nags and palfreys, to ride forth along the
"Pilgrims' Road" to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Thomas's shrine. The
pilgrims' room was divided into three apartments;
on its walls was formerly a fragment of tapestry,
representing a procession of pilgrims, which
afterwards disappeared. After the fire, says
Aubrey, "the ignorant landlord or tenant, instead
of the ancient sign, put up the Talbot or Dog."
Truly he must have been ignorant or destitute of
veneration for antiquity or poetical feeling, to
commit such an act of vandalism, and his
successors cannot have been much better not to
have restored the old time-honoured designation.</p>

<p>For all time will the name of Harry Bailly,
the jovial landlord of the Tabard towards the end
of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth
centuries, be remembered. He was a notable
burgess of Southwark, and evidently a popular
character; he is supposed to be identical with
Henry Tite Morton, who, in 1380, was assessed,
with his wife Christiana, at 2s. to a subsidy,
rented the customs of the borough in fee farm at
£10 per annum; was bailiff to Southwark, whence
his appellation, Henry le Bailly; represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>the borough in the Parliament of Westminster,
50 Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, and in that of Gloucester
2 Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> A jolly fellow he seems to have
been, well adapted for his profession:&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"A seemly man our hoste was withall</div>
      <div class="verse">For to have been a Marshal in a Hall;</div>
      <div class="verse">A large man he was, with eyen steep,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was in the merry spring time of the year
1383, as the inscription on the sign informs us&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Whenne that April with his showres sote</div>

<p>that Chaucer and his company met at the
Tabard.</p>

<p><abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Thomas of Canterbury was murdered in
the year 1170, by four knights, instigated thereto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>by a passionate exclamation of King Henry <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>,
who was at feud with him relative to the
respective rights of Monarchy and the church,
and his shrine during the intervening years had
become one of the most popular in the kingdom;
the Saxon people, down-trodden by their
Norman lords, looking upon him as a sort of
clerical Robin Hood, the defender of the rights
of the poor against Regal and Baronial
oppression, and in process of time it had become
resplendant with precious metals and gems, the
offerings of pious devotees. Says Chaucer&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent2">"Befell that in that season, on a day,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He then gives a series of photographs of the
pilgrims, representatives of various classes of the
people of England at a most eventful period of
our history—a period when Wycliffe was laying
the foundations of the Protestant Church; when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>Wat Tyler and his fellow serfs were rising in
assertion of their liberties; when Chaucer and
Gower were fashioning the English language into
shape, as contradistinguished from the Norman-French
of the Court; when the feeble Richard
occupied the throne, to be shortly driven hence
by his cousin Bolingbroke, which eventually led
to the Wars of the Roses, and resulted in the
extinction of a vast number of the Norman
families, rendering it easier for the Saxon element
of the kingdom afterwards to gain the
ascendancy.</p>

<p>Amongst the company are a knight, a worthy
man, who had done deeds of prowess in all parts
of the world, yet was meek as a maid, who was
dressed in a "fustian gipon, alle besmattered"
with marks of travel; along with him was his
son, "a younge squire, a lover and lusty
bachelor," with "lockes curl'd, as they were laid
in press;" also his attendant, a yeoman "clad in
green," and under his belt "a sheaf of peacock
arrows bright and keen."</p>

<p>A miller, "a stout carle for the nones, full big

<p>A Reeve, or land steward, a slender, choleric

<p>When this motley company had settled their
reckoning with Harry Bailly, their host, he
offered to be their guide to Canterbury, and as
this was not the time when pilgrims hobbled
along with peas in their shoes, he suggested that,
to beguile the tedium of the way, they should
each tell a tale, one going and another returning,
and that he who told the best, should, on their
return to the Tabard, be entertained at supper at
the cost of the rest, which proposition was
carried by acclamation; and the following
morning the merry party mounted their nags in
the court-yard and set forth, headed by the
landlord, beside whom rode the miller,
playing lustily on his bag-pipes until they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>got clear of the town, when the tale-telling
commenced.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that they arrived safely at
Canterbury, knelt at the shrine of the martyr,
purchased their brooches, in evidence of their
having been there, and caroused again on their
return in the Pilgrims' Hall; but Chaucer leaves
them on the road, prevented, perhaps, by
troubles or death from giving the tales of the
backward journey.</p>

<p>As the pilgrimages are coming into fashion, it
may be that fresh gatherings may take place in
Southwark; but it will not be at the Tabard,
under the guidance of Harry Bailly, but at the
London Bridge terminus, under the leadership of
Cook, the excursionist; and it is to be feared
that, instead of a Chaucer to depict the humours
of the journey, their proceedings will be narrated
by a newspaper correspondent.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h2>The Priory of the Holy Trinity, Aldgate.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Not</span> long had the Norman dynasty ruled
over England. Scarcely more than a
third of a century had elapsed since the Norman
Duke unfurled his standard at Hastings, and in
that interval the first William and the second
William had passed away, and Henry le
Beauclerk, by an act of usurpation had leapt into
the vacant throne, which belonged by right to
his elder brother Robert. The Saxon people,
reft of their lands, deprived of their liberties, and
subject to oppressive laws, had become the
vassals and serfs of their Norman feudal lords, and
chafed with sullen submission under the yoke.
Great, therefore, was their delight when their
new king announced his intention of marrying a
daughter of their old line of kings—a descendant
of the great Alfred, and they cherished hopes
that by this infusion of Saxon blood into the
veins of their future kings, the Saxon race would
be elevated in position, and that, being vastly
more numerous, they would eventually, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>marriages, absorb the Norman few and England
again become Saxon.</p>

<p>Matilda, Henry's Queen (born 1079, married
1100, died 1118), was the daughter of Malcolm
Canmore, King of Scotland, by Margaret,
daughter of Eadward, the ætheling, who was
the son of Eadmund Ironside, the lineal descendant
of King Alfred. She was originally called
Editha, which name was changed, at the request
of her godfather, Prince Robert, brother of her
future husband, who wished her to be named
after his mother. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Matildem quœ prius dicta
Edithe</span>," say Ordericus Vitalis. In the year
1093, her father was slain before Alnwick Castle,
and her mother died of grief shortly after.
Donald Bane usurped the throne of his nephew,
and Eadgar, the ætheling, removed his nephews
and nieces to England, not deeming them safe in
Scotland. Matilda was educated in the
Nunneries of Romsey and Wilton, under her
aunt, Christina, the Abbess. She had two or
three eligible offers of marriage, and it was with
some reluctance, and not until a council had
determined that she was under no religious vows,
that she accepted the hand of the king.</p>

<p>She became very popular by influencing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>king in the reformation of abuses, the granting of
charters of privileges, and making good laws.
Robert of Gloucester says&nbsp;—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Many were the good laws that were made in England</div>
      <div class="verse">Through Maud, the good Queen, as I understand."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Amongst other good deeds besides founding the
Priory, she established a hospital at <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles-in-the-Fields,
built a bridge over the river Lea, afterwards
called the bridge of Stratford-le-Bow, which
was so named because it was the first "bowed" or
arched bridge built in England, and was generally
called Maud's Bridge; made new roads, repaired
old ones, and was a benefactor to the Abbey of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Alban's, in whose "Golden Book," now in the
British Museum, is her miniature, with an
inscription, "Queen Matilde's gave us Ballwick
and Lilleburn."</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury thus sums up her
character:—"She was singularly holy ...
a rival of her mother's piety; never committing
any impropriety. Clad in hair cloth, beneath
her royal habit, in Lent, she trod the thresholds
of the churches, barefoot. Nor was she disgusted
at washing the feet of the diseased." She had
issue a son, William, drowned with his bride and
a host of nobles in the "Blanche Nef," when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>coming from Normandy, and a daughter,
afterwards the Empress Matilda, mother of
King Henry Second.</p>

<p>The most splendid act of munificence on the
part of the Queen was the foundation of the
magnificent Priory of the Holy Trinity, in the
year 1108, which became in process of time the
greatest and richest priory in the City.</p>

<p>At this period, when the City was a forest of
spires and towers, there stood, on the north-east
of Leadenhall Street, just within Aldgate, four
parish churches, those of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Michael, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalene, and the Blessed
Trinity. The church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Michael is supposed
to have been one of the most ancient Christian
temples in England; at this time the earth had
risen twenty feet above its level, and it was only
necessary to take down the tower to make way
for the priory. The body or crypt of this
venerable relic of antiquity was discovered a few
years ago, and unhappily destroyed. The church
erected to the honour of Christ and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Magdalene was founded by Siredus, charged
with an annual payment of 30s. to the Dean and
Chapter of Waltham, which the Queen compounded
for by giving them possession of a mill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>These four churches and parishes were cleared
away for the site of the priory, which was built
on the ground occupied by that of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Michael.
It was 300 feet in length facing Leadenhall
Street, and was bounded on the east by what is
now the street of Houndsditch.</p>

<p>Just outside the gate was the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Botolph the Briton, a rectory of very ancient
date, belonging to and standing on the land of
the Knighten Guild, which was given by the
knights to the prior and brethren, who rebuilt it
and placed their arms over the door. It was
repaired 1661, escaped the fire, became ruinous,
and was rebuilt 1741-4.</p>

<p>After the clearance of the land, the buildings
rapidly rose, and, when completed, were filled
with Canons Regular of the order of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine, with Norman as the Prior, and is
said to have been the first House of Canons
Regular established in England.</p>

<p>For endowment, the Queen granted to the
fraternity lands within the walls, which, when
they obtained the Soke outside the walls, was
called "the Inner Soken," the boundaries of
which are described in a book called <cite>Dunthorne</cite>,
written by one of the brethren, as extending from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Aldgate to the Bailey of the Tower, to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Olave's Church, Coleman Church, and Fen
Church, by the house of Theobald Fitzloo, "the
lane leading wherto is now stopped, because it
had been suspected of thieves," then by the
Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Michael to Lime Street, and by
the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew as far as the Chapel
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Augustine-upon-the-Wall. She gave them
also Aldgate and £25 per annum from the city of
Exeter.</p>

<p>Thus runs the deed of gift: "Maud, by the
grace of God, Queen of England, to R. Bishop of
London, and all the faithful of the Holy Church,
greeting. Be it known to you that I, by the
advice of Archbishop Anselm, and with the
assent and confirmation of my Lord King Henry,
have given and confirmed to the Church of
Christ, seated near the walls of London, free and
discharged from all subjection, as well to the
Church of Waltham, and all other churches,
except the church of St Paul, London, and the
bishops, with all things appertaining to the same,
for the honour of God, to the Canons regularly
serving God in the same with Norman the Prior,
for ever, for the redemption of souls, and of those
of our parents. I have in like manner given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>them the gate of Aldgate, with the Soc belonging
to the same, which was my lordship, and
two-third parts of the revenue of the city of
Exeter. And it is my will and I command that
the said Canons hold the lands and all things
belonging to the Church, well and peaceably and
honourably and freely, with all the liberties
and customs which my Lord, King Henry, by
his charter confirmed to them, so that neither
wrong nor injury be done to them. Witness:
William, Bishop of Winchester; Roger, Bishop
of Salisbury; Robert, Bishop of Lincoln."</p>

<p>Henry confirmed this deed, with further
privileges of sac and soc, thol and theam, ingfang
theft and outfang theft, and all other their
customs, as were within as without.</p>

<p>The Inner Soke is identical with the present
ward of Aldgate, but there is no record to show
that the priory was represented in the
Court of Aldermen for this ward, as they were
afterwards for their Outer Soken.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, in the year 1115, the Priory
had a considerable accession of landed property,
by a grant of what now constitutes the ward of
Portsoken.</p>

<p>In the reign of King Eadgar, thirteen knights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>who had done service to the realm, asked the
king to bestow upon them a tract of land lying
desolate outside Aldgate, comprising what is now
covered by the Minories, Houndsditch, Petticoat
Lane, etc., and Whitechapel to the Bars.
Eadgar consented on two conditions, that they
should each be victors in three combats,
one under ground, one upon ground, and one
above ground, and that on a certain day they
should tilt with lances against all comers in East
Smithfield. All this was accomplished by the
knights with great glory, and the king made
them a grant of the land, constituting them a
guild under the name of the "Knighten Guild,"
the land being named "Portsoken," signifying
the "Franchise at the Gate."</p>

<p>Eadgar's charter of incorporation was confirmed
by Eadward the Confessor, William <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, William
<abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, and Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the priory, the
knights of the guild, for the glory of God and the
Blessed Trinity, and out of a chivalrous
admiration of their pious Queen, gave to the
prior and canons the whole of their land,
franchise, and liberties, and the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Botolph the Briton, and took upon themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>the habit of the order, becoming members of the
fraternity.</p>

<p>In attestation of their grant they placed their
charters upon the altar of the priory church, and
gave Norman, the prior seisin of the land in the
church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph, which stood upon the land;
Barnard, Prior of Dunstable; John, Prior of
Derland; Geoffrey Clinton, Chamberlain of
London, and other clerks and laymen being
witnesses thereof. King Henry gave a confirmatory
charter, as did, afterwards, Gilbert,
William, and Roger, Bishops of London, <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Alphage, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Popes
Alexander and Innocent, the latter adding that
the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph should be served by
one of the canons of the priory, removable at the
discretion of the prior.</p>

<p>In consequence of this acquisition, the prior
was admitted as a Ward Alderman of the City
of London, the land, although lying beyond the
boundaries, being within the liberties of the City.
He met in the Council Chamber, took part in
the deliberations, feasted in the hall, and rode
forth in pageants, clad in scarlet as other
aldermen, but had his robes cut in clerical
fashion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>Allen, in his History of London, intimates that
he sat in the Guildhall, in a clerical capacity, to
look after the interests of the church, which was
not correct, his position there being the
representative of the temporalities of the Ward.</p>

<p>Prior Norman appears to have been entrusted
with the superintendence of the building of the
priory, and, like others not trained in
commercial pursuits, to have been somewhat
unthrifty in the expenditure of money, for we
find that when he had built up his refectory,
kitchen, and larder, his funds were exhausted,
and he had not the wherewithal to supply the
necessary food for his hungry canons; but the
matrons and maidens of the city passing by, and
seeing the tables laid out without the necessary
appliances, brought them loaves of bread every
Sunday for the week's consumption, until the
rents began to come in and they were able to
provide for themselves.</p>

<p>After the destruction of the four churches it
became necessary to celebrate mass in two parts
of the new church at the same time, which caused
a great deal of confusion and discord, until at
length a separate church was built for the <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Catherine's parishioners in the priory churchyard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>where mass was performed by one of the
canons; but the people were required to attend
the conventual church at festivals and fasts, and
to have their children baptised there. This gave
rise to some ill-feeling and disputes, the people
wishing to have all the services and sacraments of
religion celebrated in their own church; and in
1414, when William Haradon was prior, the
matter was referred to the Bishop of London for
arbitration, and he decreed that <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine's
should have a baptismal font, and be allowed to
ring their bells on Easter day; that they should
celebrate the feast of the dedication of their own
church within its walls, but should attend at the
festival of the dedication of the conventual
church, and then and there "give their pence,
halfpence, and farthings in token of submission;"
and that the Sacrament in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine's
Church should be administered by a canon of the
Priory, "but that the Priory should be at no
other charges for the chapel." All this the
bishop, "out of his paternal affections, yielded
unto."</p>

<p>The church was denominated <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine
Cree, the word Cree being an ancient method of
spelling the name of Christ, as pronounced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>French, and was added as being an adjunct of
the conventual or Christ Church. A bell tower
was built 1504, Lord Mayor Sir John Perceval
having left money for that purpose. The present
church was built 1630, and escaped the fire of
1666. It was at its dedication that Laud
indulged in Popish ceremonials, which aroused
the indignation of the Puritans, and assisted in
paving the way of the Archbishop to the block.
The churchyard of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine was a popular
place for the performance of moralities and
miracle plays, which took place on Sundays.
There is an entry in the parish books—"Received
of Hugh Grymes, for licence given to certain
players to play their interludes in the churchyard
from the feast of Easter <abbr title="Anno Domini">An. D'ni.</abbr> 1565, until
the feast of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Michael the Archangel, next
coming, every holyday, to the use of the parish,
27s. 8d." Hans Holbein is supposed to have
been buried in the church.</p>

<p>The Priory had not been built twenty ears
when it ran a great risk of being destroyed by
the fire of 1136, second only to the great
conflagration of 1666, which broke out near
London stone, and destroyed the City westward
to Clement's Danes, and eastward to Aldgate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>the flames sweeping up to the walls of the
Priory, northward to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral,
which was partially, or, as Matthew Paris states,
entirely, consumed, and by London Bridge,
which was of wood, and entirely burnt, into
Southwark.</p>

<p>Ralph the Prior, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1145, with the consent of
the Canons, exchanged a plot of land near the
river, in the outer-soken, and "all the mills there
in the shambles," with Maud, Stephen's queen,
for land in Hertfordshire, where she built and
endowed the Hospital of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Katherine, which
was repaired and enlarged by Queen Eleanor in
1273. It was removed to Regent's Park in
the present century to make way for <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Katherine's Docks.</p>

<p>King Henry <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> having debased the coin of the
realm, Stephen, the Prior, 1180, demanded
£25 12s. 6d. from the city of Exeter, as the then
value of the £25 per annum granted out of the
city revenues. The citizens refused to pay the
additional 12s. 6d., but were compelled by a
mandate from the King.</p>

<p>In the year 1215, when King John was at feud
with his Barons, Matthew Paris informs us that,
after the siege of Northampton, the Barons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>came, by way of Bedford and Ware, to London,
entering the City by Aldgate, and that "as they
passed along, they spoiled the Fryars' Houses
and searched their coffers," on which occasion,
doubtless, the Brethren of Holy Trinity, lying so
near the gate, would have black-mail levied on
them. At the same time they repaired the
ruined gate and put it in a state of defence,
obtaining the materials from the houses of the
Jews.</p>

<p>Eustacius, the eighth Prior, 1264, appointed
Theobald Fitz-James as his deputy in the
Aldermanship, he deeming it inconsistent with
his spiritual vocation to perform secular duties.</p>

<p>William Rising became Prior in 1377, when
there is a record of his taking the oaths as
Alderman.</p>

<p>The year 1348-9 (23rd Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>) was long
after remembered for a great pestilence, which
broke out in Northern Asia, spread over Europe,
and this year committed terrible ravages in
London. The city graveyards became choked
with corpses, and suburban cemeteries were
extemporised for the wholesale reception of the
dead. Nicholas, then Prior, sold to John Grey,
clerk of the Corporation, a plot of ground in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>outer-soken, near East Smithfield to be used as
a place of burial, with the condition annexed that
it should be called the Churchyard of the Holy
Trinity, "which ground he (John Grey) caused,
by the aid of divers devout citizens, to be enclosed
with a wall of stone." It was consecrated by
Ralph, Bishop of London, and a chapel built
"for the honour of God," and near by King
Edward built a small monastery "of our Lady of
Grace," in gratitude for preservation from
shipwreck in a tempest at sea.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, the 11th of May, 1471,
when the brethren were at Mass, they were
alarmed by an attack on Aldgate. For some
days arrows had been shot into the City over the
wall, and the houses of the outside suburb had
been burnt. The besiegers were Sir Thomas
Nevil, usually called the Bastard of Fauconbridge,
and his followers. He was a kinsman of the
Great Earl of Warwick, who, after his defection
from the cause of Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, had made him
Admiral of the Lancastrian fleet. Warwick had
fallen a month ago at Barnet, and the Yorkist
King Edward in consequence became firmly
established on the throne, when Sir Thomas
conceived the mad project of landing with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>sailors, marching to London, and re-establishing
the Lancastrian family. The Londoners shut
their gates against him, but he broke down
Aldgate on this Sunday morning, and several of
the insurgents rushed through when the
portcullis was let down, and those within were
slain by the citizens, headed by Basset, Alderman
of the ward. The Lieutenant of the Tower
then came up with a body of troops, the portcullis
was raised, and the Bastard and his followers
driven into Essex, "with sharp shot and fierce
fight," being pursued as far as Mile End.</p>

<p>The priory waxed rich, grew famous, and
nourished during a period of 433 years, no doubt
becoming luxurious, idle, and corrupt, like other
fraternities; until at length, in 1531, the end
came. King Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, wishing to reward
Sir Thomas Audley, afterwards Lord Chancellor
and first Baron Audley of Walden, for his service
as Speaker, in the impeachment of Wolsey, cast
his eye upon this Priory, sent for Nicholas
Hancock, the last Prior, whom he cajoled with
complimentary praises, commending his hospitality,
and telling him that a man of his merit and
ability deserved higher preferment, and that if he
would surrender the Priory into his (the King's)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>hands, he should have something better. After
some hesitation the Prior gave up the house, the
Canons were sent to other houses of the same
order, and the Priory, with all its appurtenances,
bestowed on Audley.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Audley determined to build
himself a mansion on the site, and offered the
church to any one who would take it down, but it
was so strongly built that no one would undertake
the cost. He then pulled it down himself, and
allowed any one to have the materials who would
carry them away, giving the four large bells to
Stepney Church, and the five smaller to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Stephen, Coleman Street. He then added new
buildings, where he dwelt until his death, 1544,
when the property passed, by the marriage of his
daughter, to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk,
who was beheaded 1572, and it was then called
Duke's Place. It descended to their son,
Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, who sold it to
the Corporation, was eventually taken down, and
streets built on the site. The only vestige
remaining is a stone arch between 73, Leadenhall
Street and 39, Mitre Court.</p>

<p>The Priory possessed a messuage, dovecote,
and garden of seven acres, on the east side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>Houndsditch, which were given to Sir T. Audley,
and which he bestowed on Magdalen College,
Cambridge. In the street leading thereto, one of
the priors had built some cottages for bedridden
people, which Stow remembered as having seen
in his boyhood, the bedridden people, men and
women, lying by the windows, that devout
persons might see them as they passed and
bestow alms upon them: which street, afterwards,
according to Munday, was inhabited by "these
men, or rather monsters in the shape of men, who
profess to live by lending, and yet will lend
nothing but upon pawns."</p>

<p>Stow, who lived in the parish of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew
Undershaft, and was buried in the parish church,
speaks from personal recollection of the Prior
"keeping a bountiful house for rich and poor, as
well within the houses as to all comers at the
gate," and, when a boy, of going to farmer
Goodman, in the outer-soken, where Goodman's
Fields now are, for milk at the rate of "three
pints, hot from the kine, for a halfpenny."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Duke's Place being left
without a church, after the demolition of the
Priory Church, attended that of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Catherine
Cree until the reign of James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, when Trinity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>Christ Church was built for them out of the ruins
of the Priory, and was consecrated in 1622. It
escaped the Great Fire, and has since been called
the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> James, Duke's Place. In
Strype's time it claimed the right of solemnizing
marriages without licence or proclamation of
banns.</p>

<h2>Convent of the Sisters Minoresses of the Order of St Clare, Aldgate.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Wondrously</span> different was Plantagenet
London from that of the Victorian era:
different in every respect, notably in size,
population, and aspect. It was chiefly comprised
within the walls, which commenced at the
Postern Gate of the Tower, and completed the
circuit at the river near the present Blackfriars
Bridge. There were a few outlying groups of
houses and villages; a road along the river strand
through the little village of Charing to
Westminster, and marshes on the north, with
causeways to the villages of Clerkenwell, Hoxton,
and Islington. It was, however, an eminently
picturesque city, with its gabled and timbered
houses, its monastic edifices, and its church
towers. It was computed that then two-thirds
of the entire space was occupied by religious
edifices and their grounds. Towards the end of
the fourteenth century there were within the
walls, eight friaries, five priories, four nunneries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>five collegiate establishments, seventeen hospitals
with resident brotherhoods, nine other religious
fraternities, and more than one hundred parish
churches. At that time the court end of the
town was the neighbourhood of the Tower.
There royalty dwelt; and clustering round were
the mansions of nobles and the town houses of
bishops and abbots.</p>

<p>The locality immediately under notice was a
road running from the Tower postern, outside the
City wall and ditch, to Aldgate, along what is
now called the Minories. Aldgate, or Ealdgate,
so named from its antiquity, was the eastern outlet
from the City, the great Essex road running
eastward therefrom. Immediately within the
gate stood the magnificent priory of the Holy
Trinity, founded by Matilda, Queen of Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>,
and close by was the town house of the Barons
Nevil, afterwards Earls of Westmoreland, who
gave an abbess to the convent of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare.
Outside the gate there stretched an open expanse
of country, with foliaged trees, meadows, and
silver streamlets, where, on holidays, the young
citizens gambolled, practised archery, and, in the
more secluded parts, whispered in the ears of the
young citizenesses "the old, old tale." Looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>eastward, the low square-towered church of the
village of Stebenhede (Stepney) by the riverside
morasses might be seen; and nearer London, its
chapel-of-ease, at the villa Beatæ Mariæ Matfelon,
on the Essex road, whilst more to the
north might be discerned the priory of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Spittal, founded a century previously. Here,
outside the gate, in the year of grace 1293,
Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and Blanche, his
countess, whilom Queen of Navarre, founded the
convent of Minoresses of the order of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare,
dedicated to the "Blessed <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary," and amply
endowed it with lands and messuages. <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare,
Clara, Claire, or Chiara, as the name is rendered
in different tongues, was born of a noble and
wealthy family at Assisi, 1193, died 1253, and
was canonized 1256. She was exceedingly
beautiful, and had many offers of marriage, but
when quite young, despite the opposition of her
parents, resolved to dedicate herself to God. <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Francis had just then founded the Franciscan
branch of the Mendicant Orders, and lived with
ten "Frati Minores," in a hut on the Porziunculo,
near Assisi, living austere lives, in absolute
poverty, depending upon charity for their daily
food, and maintaining strict silence, excepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>when it was absolutely necessary to speak. To
them Clare fled, and desired to be admitted as a
nun of the order. She was followed by her
kinsfolk, but clung with such tenacity to the
altar, that they were compelled to leave her.
She then founded the Order of Poor Clares, or
Sisters Minoresses, with rules of the most rigid
austerity, relating chiefly to abstinence, poverty,
and silence. Their bed was the bare earth, they
usually went barefooted, and were habited in
grey robes, girdled with a knotted rope, and a
white coif on the head. Within fifty years after
her death, however, they were released from the
vow of poverty, and the others were modified,
from which time they accumulated property,
built themselves comfortable houses, and indulged
in social converse. The first convent was erected
outside the walls of Assisi, but afterwards
removed within, where a splendid church—the
church of Santa Chiara d'Assisi—was erected
over her tomb. In pictures <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare is usually
represented either with the Pix, to denote piety,
or the lily, the emblem of purity. She was
generally spoken of by the nuns as the "Madre
Serafico."</p>

<p>Edmund Plantagenet, surnamed Crouchback,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>was the second son of King Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>; born
1245, died 1295. In his eighth year, 1253, he
was created Earl of Chester, and invested by the
Pope with the title of King of Sicily and Apulia,
but neither was of much value, as the former
was soon afterwards transferred to his elder
brother Edward, afterwards King Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, and
Conrad, the real King of Sicily, was still living.
He was afterwards created Earl of Leicester,
1264, and Earl of Lancaster, 1267. He fought
in the wars of Gascony, Wales, and Scotland, and
was two years in Palestine. He had grants of
the forfeited castles and manors of the rebel
barons, Simon de Montfort, Ferrers, Earl of
Derby, and Nicholas de Segrave, and had licence,
21 Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, to castellate his house, the Savoy,
in the Strand. His death occurred in France; he
had invested Bordeaux, and not being able to
reduce it, grief brought on a disease which
terminated fatally. His body was brought to
England and buried in Westminster Abbey, but
not until, in accordance with the instructions in
his will, all his debts were paid. He married,
first, Aveline, daughter and heiress of William de
Fortibus, Lord of the Seigniory of Holderness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Co. York, who <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="decessit sine prole">d.s.p.</abbr></i> the following year.
Secondly, he married Blanche, daughter of
Robert, Earl of Artois (third son of King Louis
<abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, of France), and relict of Henry, King of
Navarre, by whom he had issue Thomas, second
Earl, who, after heading the rising of the barons
against Gaveston, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, was taken
prisoner at Boroughbridge, Co. York, beheaded at
Pontefract, and attainted 1321. Henry, his
brother, was restored in the earldoms, whose son
Henry was created Duke of Lancaster, 1351, but
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="decessit sine prole mascula">d.s.p.m.</abbr></i>, leaving issue Maude and Blanche, the
latter of whom married John of Gaunt, Earl of
Richmond, afterwards Duke of Lancaster, by
whom she had issue Henry of Bolingbroke,
afterwards King Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr></p>

<p>Piously disposed, as we may charitably suppose
them to have been, or perchance for the welfare
of their souls—as it was usual, in that age, to
make bargains with Heaven to build religious
houses as the price of exemption from the pains
of purgatory—the Earl and Countess built the
nunnery in the precincts of the court, and filled it
with nuns of the order of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare, brought over
from some Continental convent by Queen
Blanche, "to serve God, the Blessed Virgin, and
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Francis," for which they had a licence from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>King Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> Stow informs us that the
frontage of the convent was fifteen perches
twenty-seven feet in length, with all needful
interior appliances, and garden land; doubtless a
pleasant home for the Sisters, with its outlook
over the Essex fields and the river Thames, with
its quaintly-fashioned vessels passing up and
down. It was well endowed by its founders, but
had other benefactors as well, and had messuages
in the Vintry, Wood Street, Lad Lane, Lombard
Street, Christ Church Lane, Shirburgh Lane,
etc. The Sisterhood also held the Manor of
Apuldercome, and had a grant from William
Walshe, 7 Edward <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, of a messuage,
called Harteshorn, in the parish of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Matfelon.</p>

<p>The original licence for the foundation is dated
21 Edward <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>. A charter was granted to "the
sisters Minoresses, without Aldgate," quitting
them of tallage of their land in the City, dated 9
Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>; and in the fourteenth of the same
reign, another to "the Abbey of the Minoresses
of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary of the order of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare, without
the walls of the City," confirming the holding of
certain lands and messuages "gotten of divers
well-affected persons." Other charters of confirmation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>were granted to the Sisterhood, 2
Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, and 1, 16, 25 Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr></p>

<p>The Sisters of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare flourished here for a
period of 246 years, praying, fasting, and
mortifying the flesh, with intervals possibly of
laughing, feasting, and enjoyment of their pleasant
home; or it may be, as we know is often the
case, even with the Angelic sex, when thrown
together for days and years, the fasting and
feasting and prayer might be mixed up with
ingredients of wrangling, envy, and jealousy,
until it all came to an end, when the ruthless
Tudor king laid his sacrilegious hands on the
monastic establishments, and spared not even
the homes of the gentler sex, and the house of
the Sisters Minoresses was surrendered by Dame
Elizabeth Salvage, 1539.</p>

<p>During these two-and-a-half centuries the
Sisters witnessed many important events in the
annals of England; the deposition and murder of
kings Edward <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> and Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, the usurpation
of Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> and Richard <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, the Wars
of the Roses, the rise of Lollardism, the Interdict
of the Kingdom under John, the Reformation, the
introduction of the press, and the birth of English
literature under Chaucer and Gower. It may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>that the prioress who rode to Canterbury with
Chaucer's pilgrims was the head of the Aldgate
Minoresses.</p>

<p>From their own windows they would see many a
gay cavalcade of barons, knights, and ladies issue
from the portals of the Tower to follow the sport
of hawking in the fields, or play at some martial
or other game, and many a brilliant procession
going forth to tournament in Smithfield, or
coronation in Westminster. They would behold
the coronation pageants and feasts in the Tower
of Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, the marriage of the rival Roses in
the persons of Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr> and the Princess
Elizabeth, and that of Prince Arthur and
Catherine of Arragon, when a splendid
tournament was held hard by. Their soft hearts
would also often be awakened to compassion at
hearing of the bloody deeds perpetrated in their
neighbourhood, the murder of the young princes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>by their uncle, Richard of Gloucester, and the
decapitation of Lord Cobham, Bishop Fisher, Sir
Thomas More, Queen Anne Boleyn, and many
another noble and distinguished personage. From
their lattices, too, they would look upon the
riding forth of the barons of the realm through
Aldgate to attend the Parliament of Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>,
1299, held at the mansion of Lord Mayor Wallis,
at Stepney; the Wat Tyler mob rushing along,
"with shouts and cries as if all the devils of hell
had come in their company," to ransack the
Tower, chop off the heads of the Lord Chancellor
and Treasurer, and rudely kiss the King's mother,
the "Fair Maid of Kent," and Princess of Wales,
in 1381; and again in 1450, that of the Jack
Cade insurgents, when they took Lord Say and
Sele from the Tower and beheaded him in
Cheapside.</p>

<p>After the dissolution, the Priory became the
residence of John Clerke, Bishop of Bath and
Wells, 1523-41, Master of the Rolls, and
Diplomatist, who was poisoned in Germany,
when sent on an Embassy to the Duke of Cleves,
to explain to him why Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr> had divorced
his sister; after whom it was inhabited by some
officials of the Tower, and in 1552 was granted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, by King Edward
<abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> Afterwards it became a storehouse for
arms, and workshops for the fabrication of
implements of warfare, but does not seem to have
been of high repute, as Dryden says, "a comic
writer who does not cause laughter, or a serious
dramatist who does not excite emotion, is no
more a good poet than is a Minories gunsmith a
good workman."</p>

<h2>The Abbey of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary of Graces, or East Minster.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the autumn of the year 1347, that
a storm-shattered vessel might be seen
threading its way up the Thames. Its single
broad sail was rent in divers places, its single
mast broken, and considerable portions of its
lofty poop and its high pointed stem reft away.
It had come from Calais, and in mid-channel had
encountered a terrific tempest, every soul on
board deeming himself lost, and offering up
heartfelt prayers to the Virgin or his favourite
saint for succour, or for intercession in case of
death. Nevertheless, like English mariners in
every after, and indeed former age, the crew
depended not on prayers alone, but battled
manfully with the winds and the waves, and at
length with great difficulty succeeded in getting
their vessel into the river, and slowly ascended
its reaches, with their rent sail fluttering in the
still boisterous wind.</p>

<p>It was said of one our Norman monarchs, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>he desired to pass over into Normandy, whilst a
storm was raging and the seamen represented the
perilous nature of the attempt, "Who ever heard
of a King being lost at sea? go I will, and at
once, storm or no storm," and he did go, arriving
safely at his destination. Perchance the fact of
this Calais ship having a king aboard, with the
immunity of kings from shipwreck, may have had
something to do with its escape from destruction,
at any rate it did survive the peril, and its having
done so was the cause of the establishment of the
Abbey of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary of Graces.</p>

<p>The royal personage who passed through the
peril of the Straits was none other than the
victor of Creci and Calais, the illustrious
Plantagenet, Edward the Third. The three sons
of Philip <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr> of France having successively died
without issue, his nephew, Philip of Valois.
according to the Salique law, became his successor,
but Edward of England claimed the throne as
son of the daughter of Philip <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, and entered
France to assert his claim. He met his rival,
Philip <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, at Creci, with 36,000 men, opposed
to the French army of 130,000, and obtained a
great victory, 36,000 of the French being slain
and the rest taking to flight. He then marched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>to Calais, which he invested and took after a
most obstinate defence of twelve months, on August
4th 1347, after which occurred the famous historic
incident of the six brave burghers of Calais
presenting themselves before the victor in their
shirts, and with ropes round their necks, as
voluntary victims to sate the vengeance of the
king and save their town, and their subsequent
pardon at the intercession of the Queen. Notwithstanding
the obstinate defence of the town,
the King could scarcely do less than accede to
Philippa's request, since within its walls she had
presented him with a fair daughter, afterwards
called Margaret of Calais.</p>

<p>His Queen and the newly-born princess were
with him in the frail bark when it was tossed
hither and thither, and its timbers riven by the
storm, and in the midst thereof he prostrated
himself and made a solemn vow, calling upon the
nobles and ecclesiastics who accompanied him to
bear witness thereto, that if God in His mercy
should permit him to land safely in England, he
would build and endow on the spot where he
landed a monastery to the honour of God and
our Lady of Graces.</p>

<p>At length, after beating up the river as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>they were able with their broken rudder and
shattered sails, the mariners drew the vessel
alongside the shore a little to the east of
East Smithfield, when the royal party landed,
and passed, amid the acclamations of the few
people congregated on the river bank, to the
Tower, and offered up thanks in the chapel for
their deliverance.</p>

<p>Very different in aspect was the district
eastward of Aldgate and the Tower when
King Edward and his retinue landed there, from
what it presents at present, with its docks,
wharves, and warehouses, its stately ships and
steam-vessels, to which the ship of King Edward
might have served as a boat slung on davits by
their side; its wilderness of houses, countless
miles of the squalid homes of wretchedness,
poverty, and crime; with multitudes of lofty
chimneys, belching forth volumes of black smoke
rising from the midst, and railways traversing it
in every direction, accompanied by the incessant
thunder of rushing trains, and the screeching
whistle of the locomotive.</p>

<p>The scene that presented itself to the monarch
when stepping upon the river bank from his
vessel was that of a flat expanse of pasture land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>and marshes, stretching away northward and
eastward, protected from inundation by the
embankment of the river, the work of the
Romans, which, however, was not always
effectual, as the Thames frequently overflowed
defective portions of the bank and laid the land
under water. There were also many rills and
streamlets meandering along from the high lands
of the north, which lost themselves in the marshes
or found an outlet into the river.</p>

<p>Scattered here and there on the more elevated
parts were a few hamlets, mere clusterings of a
few cottages, claybuilt, with cross timberings and
straw-thatched roofs, with holes for chimneys,
and in the walls latticed openings to admit light
to the interiors. These were the abodes of
cowherds, who tended their masters' cattle in the
marshes, swineherds who drove their charges into
the neighbouring forest to pick up the fallen
acorns, fishermen who plied their daily toil on the
river, and a few artizans, carpenters, smiths, and
wrights, such as are now met with in remote
country villages. These people were wretchedly
poor, half-starved, ill-clad, and profoundly ignorant,
the slaves of monkish superstition, and the
downtrodden serfs of the nobles. Yet had they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>within them the old Saxon instinct of freedom
and liberty, and they were the men who in the
following reign ranged themselves under the
banners of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw.</p>

<p>Westward stood the Tower of London, frowning
grimly on the river bank—at once a palace, a
fortress, and a prison. Stretching northward
therefrom, was the eastern wall of the City
terminating in Aldgate, whence ran the road into
Essex. Within the gate, with its tower
overtopping the wall, might be seen the magnificent
Priory of the Holy Trinity, founded by
Matilda, the Saxon Queen of Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, in the
year 1108, and outside, along the road now called
the minories, the humbler and more lowly built
convent of the Nuns Minoresses of the Order of
<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Clare, founded in 1239, by Edmund, Earl of
Lancaster. And hard by, close to the gate, was
the Church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph, formerly belonging to
the knights of the Cnighten guild, now to the
Holy Trinity Priory. Close by the landing
place was the hospital of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Katherine, founded
in 1148, by Matilda, Queen of Stephen, for the
repose of the souls of her children—Baldwin and
Matilda; refounded in 1273 by Eleanor, widow of
King Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> Eastward was <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Chad's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Well, round which grew up a hamlet, so called,
since corrupted to Shadwell. Further on lay the
hamlet of Stebenhithe (Stepney), with its low
broad-towered church. North-westward of it, in
the Essex Road, was the chapel of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Matfellon, whose name has given rise to much
discussion, without any satisfactory result.
Afterwards it was called the White Chapel, and
hence it gave the name to the line of road
running from Aldgate. Northward might be
discerned the priory and hospital of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary
Spittle, a timber building with an angle turret,
founded by Walter Brune and his wife, in the
year 1197; and not far distant, on the west, the
priory of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Helen, with its hall, hospital, cloisters,
and crypt, founded in 1210 by William Fitz-William,
and dedicated to the Holy Cross and <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Helen, mother of the Emperor Constantine.</p>

<p>Here, then, on the north side of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Katherine's Hospital, and eastward of Little
Tower Hill, King Edward laid the foundations of
the monastery, and made it subject to the
monastery of Beaulieu, in France, of which he
was the founder. It was called also East
Minster, or New Minster without the walls.</p>

<p>"In the charter of endowment, dated March
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>2nd, 1349, he gave the abbot and monks all
those messuages, with the appurtenances at
Tower Hill, which he had of John Corey, in pure
and perpetual alms, ordering the house to be
called 'The Royal Free Chapel of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Mary of
Graces.'"</p>

<p>In another charter it is said, "The king
founded this house in remembrance and acknowledgement
of the goodness of Almighty God, and
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, whom he had often called upon and
found helpful to him by sea and by land; in wars
and other perils, and therefore ordered this house
to be called 'The King's Free Chapel of the
Blessed Virgin of Graces, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in memoriam
Gratiarum</i>.'"</p>

<p>He imported some monks from Beaulieu to
occupy the house, and appointed Walter de Sta
Cruce first president of the chapel, "whom he
enjoined kindly to receive and treat the said
religious who were to profess religion in the said
chapel."</p>

<p>The house was a stately building of the new
decorated Gothic, with its floriated windows,
crocketted pinacles, flying buttresses, and
clustered pillars, presenting a fair aspect to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>passers by on the river, as it stood a little way
back from the bank, glowing in its pristine
freshness and beauty. And the boatmen would
rest on their oars and listen to the matins or
vespers chanted by the brethren within its
walls.</p>

<p>In the 50th year of his reign, the King further
augmented the endowment by placing the Manors
of Poplar, of Gravesend, and other manors in
Kent, in trust for the abbey.</p>

<p>Of the Abbots, the names of but few have
survived. William de Santa Cruce, formerly
Abbot of Geronden, was the first, to whom the
king made an allowance of £20 per annum for the
maintenance of the household.</p>

<p>William Warden, probably his successor, was
Abbot in 1360. Paschalis occurs in a record of
the eighth Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, 1418. John Langton is
named, in 1495, in a bequest from Jane Hall, of
a tenement for her soul's health. In 1494 he
was presented to the vicarage of Gedington,
and in 1498, by Sir T. Lovelace, to that of
Stokedanbey in the diocese of Lincoln. John,
probably the same, occurs in 1503. Henry More
made his profession as Abbot in 1516.</p>

<p>The house was surrendered in 1539, when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>revenues were estimated at £602 12s. 6d. gross,
and £546 10s. net per annum.</p>

<p>Dugdale says: "Of the manner of the
surrender we find no account which gives
occasion to guess that it was done by
such as were in no authority, and therefore
it was thought fit to conceal the
knowledge thereof. It was granted by Henry
<abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, 34th, to Sir Arthur D'Arcy; was clean
pulled down, and of late times, in place thereof,
is built a large storehouse for victuals, and
convenient ovens are built there for baking
biskets for the Royal Navy, and it is the
victualling office for the same to this day. The
grounds adjoyning, and belonging formerley to
the said abbey, have small tenements built
thereon."</p>

<p>Maitland, 1772, in his <cite>History of London</cite>, says
that a portion of the original building was then
standing, "now converted into a bisket bake-house,"
which is probably an error, as Dugdale
states that it was "clean pulled down."</p>

<p>In the Chapter House, Westminster, there is
an impression of the seal of the abbey, appended
to an indenture for the foundation of Henry
<abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr>'s Chapel. In the centre is the Virgin with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>the infant Jesus, with a royal personage—probably
Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>—kneeling in prayer on
the dexter side, and a group of figures on the left.
Underneath is a shield of the Royal arms, and
the legend, <span class="smcap lowercase"><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">SIGIL LUM COMVNE MONASTERIJ BEATE

<h2>The Barons Fitzwalter of Baynard's Castle.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was with mutterings of discontent and
gloomy forebodings that Saxon London
beheld, soon after the victory at Hastings, the
erection of a fortress at the east end of their
city—replaced soon after by the earliest portion
of the present Tower of London—and two huge
castles to the west, ostensibly to guard, really to
keep the City in awe. Duke William, after the
Battle of Hastings, knowing how important it
was to hold possession of the largest and most
influential city in the kingdom, hastened up to
London. The citizens, who felt not disposed to
surrender their liberty to a foreigner, and who,
influenced by Archbishop Stigand, had caused Eadgar
the Atheling to be proclaimed king, crossed the
river to oppose his advance but were repulsed;
nevertheless, the Conqueror did not follow up
his success by entering London, but burnt
Southwark and went to subjugate the western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>counties. During his absence, the citizens
deeming it the best policy to submit, at any rate
for the present, tendered their homage to him at
Berkhamstead. Suspicious, however, of their
loyalty, he caused the castles to be erected, and
to conciliate the citizens granted them a charter
of four and a half lines written in Saxon, on a
piece of parchment six and a half inches long and
one broad. This laconic charter ran thus:—"William
the King salutes, with friendly
greeting, William the Bishop, and Godfrey the
Portreve, and all the burgesses within London,
both French and English, and I declare that I
grant you to be all law-worthy as you were in
the days of King Edward; and I grant that
every child shall be his father's heir, after his
father's days; and I will not suffer any person to
do you wrong. God keep you."</p>

<p>The two western castles were built, at the
confluence of the Fleet with the Thames. The
one by the Baron Montfichet, soon afterwards
destroyed by fire, stood at the bottom of Addle
Hill, where the Carron Wharf is now located, and
its western walls were washed by the Fleet, whose
course was afterwards diverted further
westward to make a site for the Dominican
Friary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>It was built by the Norman, Ralph Baynard,
feudal baron of Little Dunmow, Essex, who had
followed the Conqueror to England, and was
rewarded for his services at Hastings with grants
of land in Essex and Middlesex, and, in connection
with Baynard's Castle, the military
governorship of London, as castellan and standard-bearer
of the City.</p>

<p>William, third lord, sided with Helias, Earl of
Maine, in his attempt to throw off his allegiance
to King Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, for which he was attainted,
and his estates and honours given to Robert Fitz
Richard, fifth son of Richard de Tonbridge,
descended by the bend sinister from the Dukes of
Normandy.</p>

<p>The church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, on the east side of
Puddle-dock Hill, is supposed to have been built
by Ralph Baynard, and was called "<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew
juxta Baynard Castle" until the erection, near
by, of the King's Wardrobe, when it came to be
called "<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew by the Wardrobe." It was
repaired by the parishioners in 1627, destroyed
in the Great Fire of 1666, and rebuilt in 1672.
The advowson was held by the Fitzwalters, and
after passing through various hands came to the
Crown in 1633.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>This Robert was steward and cupbearer to
King Henry <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, and a great favourite with that
monarch, who, upon the attainder of William
Baynard, bestowed upon him his forfeited estates,
including the barony of Dunmow, and the castle
by the Thames, with its appurtenant civic offices.
He took an active part with Longchamp, Bishop
of Ely, against the designs of John, Earl of
Moreton, upon the crown, during the absence of
his brother, Richard <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, in Palestine; died in
1198, and was buried at Dunmow. Robert
Fitzwalter, his eldest son, died in 1234.</p>

<p>The tyranny of King John caused great
discontent amongst the barons, with whom
Fitzwalter agreed in sentiment, and this discontent
was brought to a head, driving the barons to take
up arms, by a flagrant attempt on the honour of
Fitzwalter's family. Matilde, "the fair," his
daughter was exceedingly beautiful, and John
attempted her chastity, which she indignantly repelled;
"whereupon," says Stow, "and for other
causes of the like sort, there ensued a war throughout
the realm. The barons being received into
London did great damage to the king; but in the
end the king did not only banish the said Fitzwalter,
among others, out of the realm, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>caused his castle and other houses to be
demolished. After that a messenger was sent to
Matilda the Fair about the king's suit, but she
not consenting to it, was poisoned." This was
done at Dunmow, by sprinkling a deadly poison
on a poached egg, which she ate.</p>

<p>Her exiled father retired to France, and
entered into the service of the king. In the year
1214, John of England invaded France, and
concluded a truce with the French for five years.
The two armies lying on each side of a river one
day, soon after the signing of the treaty, an
English knight of great strength and valour came
forth and challenged any French knight to a
joust, when Fitzwalter crossed the river in
acceptance thereof, and at the first course
unhorsed his antagonist in gallant style. "By
God's truth," exclaimed John, "he is a king
indeed who is followed by such a knight as that!"
"He is your own knight, O king," said one of
his attendants, "Robert Fitzwalter whom you
banished." Upon this the king sent for him to
his tent, restored him to favour, gave him back
his estates, and granted him permission to repair
his castle and houses.</p>

<p>The tyranny of the king, however, compelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>the barons again to take up arms, to establish on
a sure basis the laws and liberties granted by
Edward the Confessor, of whom Fitzwalter
became the head by the title of "Marshal of the
Army of God and of the Church." Eventually
they obtained the reluctant signature of the
Magna Charta at Runnymede, when Fitzwalter
was one of the twenty-five barons appointed to enforce
the observance of the charter. In the reign
of Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> he fought with great bravery under
the baronial banner at the Battle of Lincoln,
where he was taken prisoner, but was not
detained long, as the next year he went as a
crusader to the Holy Land, and displayed great
valour at the siege of Damietta.</p>

<p>Camden informs us that he instituted the
custom of the flitch of bacon of Dunmow. He
says: "On the Priory here" (Dunmow), "Robert
Fitzwalter (a powerful baron in the time of
Henry the Third) instituted a custom that
whoever did not repent of his marriage, nor
quarrelled with his wife within a year and a day,
should go to Dunmow and have a gamon of
bacon. But the party was to swear to the truth
of it, kneeling upon two hard pointed stones
set in the Priory churchyard for the purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>before the prior, the convent, and the whole
town."</p>

<p>Sir Robert, <abbr title="knight">Kt.</abbr>, his grandson, was summoned
to Parliament by writ, 23rd Edward <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> (1295)
and died in 1325. In 1275 he alienated
Baynard's Castle, by licence, to Robert
Kilwardby, Archbishop of Canterbury, who
removed hither the Dominican or Black Friars
from Holborn, but took special care to reserve all
the rights and official duties connected with his
barony.</p>

<p>In the year 1303, before Sir J. Blount, <abbr title="knight">Kt.</abbr>,
Lord Mayor, a specification of his duties to the
City was drawn out, which he swore upon the
Evangelists to observe, and to the utmost of his
power to maintain the rights and liberties of the
citizens. His privileges and immunities in
connection therewith are also given, which were
confirmed by Sir John on the part of the
Corporation. As this document presents some
curious features of London life in the beginning
of the 14th century, it is given below <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>.</p>

<p>The Rights that belonged to Robert Fitzwalter,
Chastilion and Banner-Bearer of London
and Lord of Wodeham.</p>

<p>"The said Robert and his heirs ought to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>and are chief Banner-bearers of London in and
for the Castlry which he and his ancestors have
of Baynard's Castle in the said City. In time of
war the said Robert and his heirs ought to serve
the City in manner hereinafter written.</p>

<p>"That the said Robert ought to come upon
his Horse of Service, with 20 men at arms,
mounted, harnessed with mail or iron, even to
the great door of the Minster of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul, with a
Banner of his Arms displayed before him. And
when he has thus come, then ought the Lord Mayor
of London, with the Sheriffs and Aldermen, come on
foot out of the Minster to the said door, with his
banner in his hand, and the banner ought to be
gules, an image of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul d'or, the feet, hands,
and head, argent, with a sword argent, in the
hand of the said Image.</p>

<p>"And as soon as they shall have come forth,
the said Robert shall alight from his horse and
salute the Mayor, as his companion, saying, 'Sir
Mayor, I am come to do my Service which I owe
to the City,' and the Mayor shall answer, 'We
allow you here as our Banner-Bearer, this banner
of the City to carry and govern to your power,
to the honour and profit of our City.' Then
shall the said Robert take the banner in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>hand, and the Mayor, Alderman, and Sheriffs
shall present him with a horse of £20 value,
with a saddle, garnished with the arms of the
said Robert, and covered with a sendal of the
same arms, and deliver £20 to his Chamberlain
for the charges of the day.</p>

<p>"The said Robert shall then mount the horse,
banner in hand, and desire the Mayor, forthwith,
to cause a Marshall to be chosen out of the host
of London, which being done, he shall then cause
the signal to be sounded through the City, for
the commons to assemble, and follow the banner
carried by the said Robert to Aldgate, and a
Council of two sage persons from each ward be
chosen, in the Priory of the Holy Trinity, to
look to the safe keeping of the City in case the
said Robert should have to absent himself for the
purposes of war. And if the said Robert with
the army of London shall continue for the space
of a year at the siege of any town or castle, he
shall have 100 shillings from the commonalty of
London, and no more. These are the rights of
the said Robert in times of war; in times of
peace they are as follows:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"That is to say, the said Robert shall have a
soke or ward in the said City, viz., from the wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>of the canonry of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul, as a man goes by the
Bracine (brew-house) of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul to the Thames,
and so to the side of the mill standing by the
water that runs down by Fleet Bridge, and
thence by the wall, round about the Friers
preachers to Ludgate, and so return by the back
of the said Fryers' House, to the corner of the
said canons' walls of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul. That is to say, all
the parish of the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, which is
in his gift in right of his lordship. Appendant
to his soke he hath all these things under-written:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"That he shall have a Soke-man of his own
choice, provided he be of the Sokemannery of
the Ward, and if any of the Sokemannery be
impleaded at the Guildhall, his sokeman may
demand a court of the said Robert, which shall be
granted by the Mayor and Citizens. And if any
thief be taken in his soke, he shall have stocks
and prison in the soke and be taken hence to the
Guildhall before the Mayor of judgment, but
which shall not be pronounced until he is
brought into the court of the said Robert and
Franchise; and if the judgment be death for
treason he shall be tied to a post in the Thames
for two tides, and if he be a common Larcin he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>shall be hanged at the Elms and there suffer his
judgment, as other thieves. Also the said
Robert and his heirs have a great honour in
holding such a franchise in the said City, where
the Mayor and Citizens ought to do him right,
that is to say, that when the Mayor is minded to
call a great council he shall call the said
Robert or his heirs thereto, and he shall be
sworn thereof against all people saving the king
and his heirs. And when the said Robert
cometh to the Hustings of the Guildhall of the
said City, the Mayor or his Lieutenant shall
arise against him and set him down near to him;
and so long as he is in the Guildhall all the
judgments shall be pronounced by him, according
to the records of the Recorders of the said
Guildhall. And all the waifs which shall happen
whilst he is there he shall give to the bailiffs of
the City or to whomsoever he pleases, by advice
of the Mayor of said City."</p>

<p>Robert, second baron, died in 1328, three years
after his father.</p>

<p>Sir John, <abbr title="knight">Kt.</abbr>, third baron, died in 1361, who
was knighted for his bravery in war.</p>

<p>Walter, fourth baron, died in 1386. In the
44th Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, he was captured when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>fighting in Gascony, and was obliged to mortgage
one of his castles for £1,000 to raise money for
his ransom. He held many other military
employments.</p>

<p>Walter, fifth baron, died in 1407, having
married Joane, sister and heiress of John, second
Baron Devereux, who died in 1379, when the
Baronies of Fitzwalter and Devereux became
united, Walter Fitzwalter becoming Baron
Devereux, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure uxoris</i>, his heir succeeding in his
own right.</p>

<p>Humphrey, sixth baron, died <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="sine prole">s.p.</abbr></i>, a minor, in
1422. Walter, his brother, seventh baron, was
summoned from 1429 and died in 1432, the last
of the line of the Fitzwalters. He fought under
Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> in the French wars with great
distinction, and for his services had a grant of
lands in Normandy. His daughter and heiress,
Elizabeth, conveyed the baronies by marriage to
Sir John Radcliffe, <abbr title="knight">Kt.</abbr>, an eminent military
commander, who became Baron Fitzwalter, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure
uxoris</i>. Dying 39th Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, he was
succeeded by his son, Sir John, <abbr title="knight">Kt.</abbr>, who was
beheaded in 1495 for implication in the Perkin
Warbeck Conspiracy, attainted, and the barony
forfeited. Nevertheless, his son, Robert, finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>favour at the court of Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr> was restored
in blood and estates; and in the 1st Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>
to the forfeited barony. For bravery in the
French Wars, and other services to the State, he
was created Viscount Fitzwalter in 1529, and
four years after further elevated in the peerage
to the Earldom of Sussex, and was decorated
with the order of the Garter. He was thrice
married, having issue by all his wives, and died
in 1542, when he was succeeded by his eldest son,
Sir Henry, K.B. and K.G., who died in 1556,
from whom descended Sir Edward, sixth
Viscount and Earl, who died, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="sine prole">s.p.</abbr></i>, 1641, when
these honours became extinct, the barony falling
into abeyance, as it remained during the civil wars
and after the Restoration, until 1669, when it
was called out, in the person of Benjamin
Mildmay, descended from Frances, second
daughter of Sir Henry, second Earl of Sussex,
who married Sir Thomas Mildmay, of Mulsho,
Essex. He died in 1679, was succeeded by his
eldest son Charles, who died <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="sine prole">s.p.</abbr></i> 1728, to whom
followed his brother Henry, who in 1730 was
created Viscount Harwich and Earl Fitzwalter;
but dying, in 1753, without surviving issue, the
two latter titles became extinct, and the barony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>fell into abeyance, which was terminated in 1868,
in the person of Sir Brook William Bridges, fifth
baronet, who was called to the House of Peers as
Baron Fitzwalter, of Woodham Walter, in the
county of Essex, and who died in December,
1875. Having thus disposed of the Barons,
Viscounts, and Earls Fitzwalter, it becomes us to
inquire into the subsequent history of the old
Norman castle, which, flinging its shadow over
the then silvery Thames, was the home of the
Castellans of London. We have no record of
what the Castle of Ralph Baynard was like, but
may presume that it was in the usual Norman
style, heavy and ungainly, and in its general
features not unlike that given in Aggas's Map,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Elizabeth, as it appeared after its restoration
in the 15th century. A view of it was
published in 1780, and its site is indicated in the
map of Baynard Castle Ward in Northouk's
<cite>History of London</cite>. It appears to have been a
huge, quadrangular block, the body presenting
five gabled divisions, with sextangular corner
towers, each division and the towers containing
two lofty stories, with narrow slits for windows,
and rooms in each gable. Little is known of the
castle after its alienation to the Dominicans in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>1275, until the reign of Henry <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> It appears
to have come to the Crown, and was in the
possession of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
fourth son of King Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>, to whom it had
probably been granted by that king. In 1428 it
was partially destroyed by fire, but was re-edified
by the duke, who continued to reside within its
walls until his death. Incurring the jealousy and
hatred of Margaret of Anjou and her faction, the
duke, who was arrested on a charge of high
treason when attending the Parliament of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Edmundsbury, 1446, at the instance of the queen
was committed to prison, and there murdered by
suffocation or strangulation, when the castle
reverted to the Crown.</p>

<p>In 1460 the Earl of Warwick defeated the
Lancastrians at the second battle of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Alban's,
the result of which was a deputation to Edward,
Earl of March, now Duke of York, and living in
Baynard Castle, to request him to assume the
Crown; and it was from its portals that he went
in procession to <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's to hear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>
sung for the Yorkist Victory, and hence to
Westminster, to be vested in the mantle of
Royalty, after which he summoned a great
council of barons and ecclesiastics to Baynard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>Castle, to consult with them on the state of the
realm. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was
residing in Baynard Castle, after the murder of
his nephews, when he was waited upon by the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, for the
purpose of requesting him to assume the Crown.
Shakespeare delineates the scene with wonderfully
graphic power in his drama of <cite>King Richard <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr></cite>,
act 3, scene 7.</p>

<p>King Henry <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr> occupied the castle as a
place of residence some three or four years; and
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr> expended large sums of money in
repairs and embellishment, and entertained there
the King of Castile, but appears to have granted
it to the Earl of Pembroke, a gentleman of the
bedchamber, who had married Anne, sister of
Queen Katherine Parr. On the death of
Edward <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr> he favoured the pretensions of Lady
Jane Grey to the Crown, but almost immediately
changed his opinion; and in his City castle a
council was held, where it was determined that
Mary, King Edward's sister, should succeed, and
she was at once proclaimed Queen at Cheapside
Cross. In the reign of Elizabeth it appears to
have been occupied by Sir John Fortescue,
master of the wardrobe, close by, and the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>is said to have supped there occasionally. It
afterwards became the town residence of the
Earls of Shrewsbury, coming to that family,
probably, through the marriage of John, the
tenth earl, with Mary, daughter of Sir Francis
Fortescue, and so remained until the Great Fire
of 1666, when the venerable old castle, which had
witnessed so many important and tragical events
connected with the City of which it was the
guardian, was finally, and for ever, destroyed, not
a vestige now remaining.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>Sir Nicholas Brember, Knight, Lord Mayor of London.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Edward</span> <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> was one of the greatest of
English kings, and the progenitor, by
Philippa of Hainault, of a family of stalwart sons,
brave warriors and able statesmen, whose names
will long live in the annals of England and the
poetry of romance. They were Edward the
Black Prince, the hero of Creci and Poictiers;
Lionel, Duke of Clarence; John of Gaunt,
"time-honoured Lancaster," titular king of
Castile, father of King Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr> and of two
queens, and the most conspicuous figure in the
pages of Froissart; and Thomas, Duke of
Gloucester, the most persistent opponent of his
nephew, King Richard, and his government by
favourites.</p>

<p>Unfortunate was it for England that the
Prince of Wales died prematurely, and
equally unfortunate was it that he left behind
him a son, by the quondam "fair maid
of Kent," who succeeded to the throne of his
grandfather as Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> at eleven years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>age, A.D. 1377. In his nonage a council was
appointed for the government of the realm, from
which all his uncles, the best fitted by affinity
and great abilities for the office, were excluded;
a measure which gave rise to jealousy and
antagonism on their part to his government, with
disastrous results to the king's favourites, and
ultimately to the king himself. Richard was
spoilt by adulation and flattery, and became the
tool of intriguers; never displaying much
ability, caring more for the display of his
grandeur than for the good government of his
people; desiring to rule absolutely, but lacking
the power; impetuous, fierce, revengeful, and
weak-minded, and attempting to accomplish by
crooked ways what would have been better
carried out by straightforward measures. His
chief favourites were Robert de Vere, ninth Earl
of Oxford, created Marquis of Dublin in 1336,
and Duke of Ireland the following year: Michael
de la Pole, a Hull merchant, created Baron de la
Pole 1366 and Earl of Suffolk 1385; Alexander
Nevill (a younger son of Ralph, second Baron
Nevill), Archbishop of York; Sir Robert
Tresilian, Chief Justice; and Sir Nicholas
Brember, Knight, alderman of London.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir Nicholas was a merchant of London of
considerable wealth and influence. He is styled
by Froissart, "King's Draper," but seems rather
to have been a wholesale merchant. Towards
the end of the reign of Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> the ancient
trade-guilds, crafts and mysteries which had
hitherto been confined, each to one special trade,
were reconstructed as Livery Companies, by
charter, and endowed with certain privileges and
immunities; as the means of developing
commerce.</p>

<p>From <cite>Rot Parl.</cite> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 278, it appears that at this
period, certain wholesale merchants established
the "Grossers' Company," which threatened to
ruin some of the smaller crafts. In a petition, 36
Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>, it is stated that "great mischief had
arisen, as well to the king, as to the great men
and commons, from the merchants called Grossers,
who engrossed all manner of merchandize
vendible, and who suddenly raised the price of
such merchandize within the realm, putting to
sale, by covin and by ordinances, made by themselves,
and keeping goods in store till times of
dearth, etc.," suggesting as a remedy that these
merchants should not be permitted to deal in
more than one class of these commodities; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>an Act based upon this suggestion was passed 37
Edward <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> Although Brember was one of the
original members of this monopolizing company,
he enforced the penalties provided by the Act
with great strictness, as, when he was Lord
Mayor in 1385, he disfranchised several freemen
for carrying on trades other than their own.</p>

<p>At this time the aldermen were elected
annually until 17 Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, when they were
chosen for life, or during good behaviour.
Brember, who had been elected several years in
succession, served the office of sheriff in 1372,
and that of Lord Mayor not less than four times—in
the years 1377, 1383, 1384, and 1385, being
the first alderman who held the office in two
consecutive years. This, however, was not by
the goodwill of the freemen, but in opposition of
their wishes, the citizens being favourers of the
Duke of Gloucester, and disliking Brember as
one of the evil counsellors of the king. In the
<cite>Chronicle of London</cite>, printed 1827, from a MS.
in the British Museum, is the following passage:—"Also
this yere Sr. Nicholl Brembre was
chosen Maire agene be the saide craftes, and by
men of the contre at Harrow and the contre
there aboughte, and not be fre eleccion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>citee of London, as it owith to be; and the olde
halle was stuffed with men at armes overe even
be ordinaunce and assente of Sr Nicholl Brember
fur to chose hym maire on the morrowe, and so
he was." This interference with the rights of
free election was not allowed to pass without
remonstrance. "The folke of the Mercerye"
made it the subject of a petition to the
King, in which they stated that "Though
the eleccion of mairelte was to be to the fremen
of the citee bi gode and paisable avys of the
wysest and trewest, at a day in the yere, frelich,"
(free) "Nichol Brembre wyth his upberers, had
through debate and stronger partye and carrying
grete quantities of armure to the Guyldehall,"
overawed the citizens and procured his re-election,
adding that they of the Mercery or other crafts
protested against the election as illegal, "they
were anon apeched for arrysers ageins the pees"
(impeached as the disturbers of the peace).
Although Brember's election was not set aside,
this and other remonstrances led to certain
reforms in the Corporation.</p>

<p>In 1381 the memorable meeting between King
Richard and the Kentish rebels took place in
Smithfield, when their leader, Wat Tyler, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>stabbed by Lord Mayor Walworth, and when the
boy king, by a bold and masterly act, appeased
the mob, who were preparing to avenge the
death of their captain. Speed informs us that
Walworth, after the fall of Tyler, rushed into the
City and returned accompanied by Sir Robert
Knowles and a thousand citizens in armour, when
he "commanded the head of Wat Tyler to be
chopt of from his dead carcase and borne
before him on a speare to the king." Froissart
says, "among the first" (from the City) "came
Sir Robert Knolles and Sir Perducas d'Albret
well attended, then several aldermen, with
upwards of 600 men at arms, and a powerful man
of the City, by name Nicholas Brember, the
king's draper, bringing with him a large force on
foot." After the dispersion of the mob with
ample promises of a redress of their grievances,
the king knighted Walworth, and gave him a fee
farm worth £100 per annum, as he did also
Aldermen Brember, Philpot, Laund, Standish,
Twiford, and Traver, granting to each a fee farm
of £40 per annum. Thomas of Woodstock, the
king's youngest uncle, created Duke of Gloucester,
1385, was the most vehement opponent of his
nephew's policy, and the favourites Vere, Pole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>and Brember, perceiving him to be the greatest
obstacle to their assumption of the supreme
direction of affairs conspired to remove him.
They arranged that he should be invited to a
supper in Brember's house, and whilst there
should be assassinated. It was, however,
necessary that the invitation should be sent
through Lord Mayor Exton, "who," says
Maitland, "was no sooner acquainted with this
wicked design than he received it with the
utmost abhorrence and detestation, and boldly
declared that he would never consent to so
flagitious an act of villainy," and forthwith gave
information to the duke, who took measures for
his safety, and resolved upon the destruction of
the conspirators, in which he was backed by the
citizens of London, who suggested that he should
assume the government of the country, hinting
that they would be ready to give him support.
This, however, was not a practicable scheme, for
even if York and Lancaster should approve of
the deposition of Richard, they, as elder brothers,
would have prior claims to the succession.</p>

<p>The question was brought before the Parliament
of 1386, which met at Westminster, when
a council of eleven, with Gloucester at the head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>was appointed to govern the kingdom under the
king, who was required to dismiss Pole, his
chancellor, and the rest of his favourites, which
he promised to do, but as soon as Parliament
broke up he carried them with him into the west
of England to devise measures for opposing the
confederacy. They resolved to take up arms
against the duke, and, as a preliminary, called a
council of the judges at Nottingham, who, under
compulsion, declared the acts of the Parliament
invalid, and those who passed them traitors.
Whilst at Bristol the king sent Pole, Brember,
and Sir Peter Gouloufre to London for intelligence,
where they had an interview with the
governor of the Tower, who told them that they
ran great risk in coming there. "How so," they
inquired; "we are the king's knights, and have a
right of entry into his palaces?" The governor
replied "that it was true the Tower belonged
to the king, and that he would be obedient to
him, but could no further than when his orders
were not in contravention to the will of the
council and the Duke of Gloucester; and (added
he) I tell you for your welfare that you had
better depart, for if it become known that you
are here, the Tower will be besieged by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>citizens, and you will be torn to pieces." Upon
hearing this they departed, not caring to brave
the fury of a London mob, returned to
Kensington, mounted their horses, and rode back
to the king.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gloucester and his nephew, the
Earl of Derby, afterwards King Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr>,
finding that none but the most decided measures
would prevail with the king, raised an army of
40,000 men, with which they marched towards
London—not with the object of dethroning the
king, but to uphold the council and destroy the
power of the favourites. Richard, who was not
deficient in boldness, came to London, and it was
reported that Brember and Sir Thomas Trivet
accompanied him with a thousand armed men,
who were secretly placed in the mews at Charing
Cross, with the view of killing the most obnoxious
of the king's enemies as they passed from London
to Westminster.</p>

<p>Richard kept state in Westminster Hall, and
when he was informed of the rumours relative to
Brember and his thousand men, swore solemnly
that he knew nothing about them, but contrived to
get them away and join De Vere in the West, who
was raising an army in Wales in the king's service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>When the lords presented themselves before
the king, the Bishop of Ely, the new Lord
Chancellor, asked them why they were assembled
in warlike array at Haringey Park, to whom
they replied, "For the good of the king and the
kingdom, and to weed out the traitors by whom
he is surrounded." On being asked to name the
traitors, they answered, "Robert de Vere, Duke
of Ireland; Alex. Nevill, Archbishop of York;
Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; Sir Robert
Tresilian, that false Justicier; and Sir Nicholas
Brember, that false knight of London;" and then
threw down the gage of challenge. The king,
having sent his favourites out of immediate harm's
way, rated the lords soundly for presuming to
take up arms against his supreme will and
authority. "You," said he, "whom I could kill
like cattle, and whom I esteem no more than the
basest scullion in my kitchen!" yet he eventually
promised that the matter should be taken into
consideration by the Parliament, which would
assemble at Westminster on the morrow after
Candlemas.</p>

<p>A proclamation was soon after issued by
Richard, forbidding any one, under pain of death,
to supply arms, ammunition, or provisions to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>rebel army, and he sent word to De Vere to
hasten his muster of men, and march towards
London to put down the rebellion. Simultaneously
with the proclamation, the confederates
sent a letter to the Corporation of London,
soliciting their sympathy and aid, which was
immediately responded to with assurances of both.</p>

<p>The Duke of Ireland, with his Welsh army,
marched eastward and came to Oxford, when he
heard that the Dukes of Gloucester and York
and Lord Mayor Exton were coming to meet
him, and were not far distant, having crossed the
Thames by Reading Bridge—those of Staines
and Windsor having been broken down by
direction of de Vere. He had been appointed
Lieut.-General of the king's forces, with Suffolk
and Brember in command under him; but on
hearing this intelligence he became terribly
alarmed. He called a council of war, and it was
decided that they must give battle to the enemy;
but it was also arranged that they—De Vere, De
la Pole, and Brember—should station themselves
on fleet horses in the wings of the army, so that
if the day went against them, they might save
themselves by flight.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the army of Gloucester made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>its appearance, and the King's Welshmen, panic
stricken, threw down their arms, and took to
flight in disorder. Their leaders followed—or set
the example—and escaped to Wales, and hence
De Vere, De la Pole, and the Archbishop gained
the Continent by way of Scotland, the Duke of
Ireland dying an exile in Holland, Suffolk in
France, and Nevill as a parish priest in Flanders.
With respect to the others. Froissart says:
"Brember was arrested in Wales, brought to
London, and beheaded;" Speed: "Sir N.
Brember and others were aprehended, and kept
in straight prison to answere such accusations
(which if meere calumniations) as in the next
Parliament at Westminster, should be objected.
Parliament met at Candlemas: Tresilian had
sentence to be drawn to Tyburne in the
afternoone, and there to have his throat cut,
which was done accordingly. This Bramber"
(saith Walsingham) "was saide to have imagined
to bee made Duke of New Troye (the olde
supposed name of London), by murthering
thousands of such citizens (whose names he had
billed for that purpose) as were of such likelihood
to oppose him." Maitland says, "Soon after
Nicholas Brember, late Lord Mayor of London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>one of the wicked favourites of Richard, was condemned
by Parliament for High Treason, for which
he was adjudged to be drawn and hanged, which
was accordingly executed upon him at Tyburn, and
not according to that idle story mentioned by
Holingshed, Stow, and others, of his being
beheaded with an ax, which he had prepared for
the execution of all such as opposed his measures.
If this perfidious and cruel man and his accomplices
had succeeded in their wicked schemes he
was to have been made Duke of New Troye, as
London is denominated by the fabulous Geoffrey
of Monmouth."</p>

<p>Brember was buried in Christ Church,
Newgate Street. His arms are emblazoned in
the Hall of the Grocers' Company.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>An Olden Time Bishop of London: Robert de Braybrooke.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the pleasant Northamptonshire village of
Braybrooke, on the verge of a forest, and
near the Leicestershire border, there was born,
some five-and-a-half centuries ago, a child who
was destined to pass his name down to posterity
in the annals of London.</p>

<p>In the earlier portion of the thirteenth century,
Robert May, otherwise de Braybrooke, a
favourite of King John, and landed proprietor in
Braybrooke, built a castle on his estates for his
residence. His eldest son, Henry, married
Christian Ledlet, a great heiress, and assumed
the name of Ledlet. The estates passed by
marriage to the Griffin family, who were created
Barons de Braybrooke, 1688, the barony
expiring for lack of male heirs, 1742; but the
heiress married William Whitwell, whose son
assumed the name of Griffin and was created
Baron Braybrooke, 1788, with limitation to his
nephew, Richard Neville Aldworth, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>succeeded to the barony, and assumed the name
of Neville in addition to and after Aldworth, from
whom is descended the extant Baron Braybrooke.
Henry de Braybrooke, probably the son of
Robert, was a "justice itinerant" in county
Beds. and was dragged from the bench at
Dunstable by the Norman Falcasius—who held
Bedford Castle for the King against the barons—and
cast into a dungeon of the castle for having
given adverse judgments in thirty-five law suits
which had been instituted by Falcasius.</p>

<p>The boy Robert was probably born in the
castle, and educated in the little monastery in the
forest hard by, or possibly in the more distant
great abbey of Medehamsted (Peterborough), and
in his youthful wanderings would doubtless sometimes
visit the neighbouring town of Lutterworth,
where Wyclif, the leader of the Lollards,
Braybrooke's victims, was afterwards to pass
away from this world.</p>

<p>After his preliminary studies he went to
Oxford, where he became a licentiate of civil law,
and took Holy Orders.</p>

<p>His very first act after ordination displays his
character as a determined supporter of Papal
supremacy, and at the same time demonstrates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>the influence of his family. In spite of the
statute of provisors, recently passed, and of
præmunire, he obtained a provision from the
Pope for induction into the living of Hinton, in
Cambridgeshire, the patronage being vested in
the Fellows of Peterhouse; and notwithstanding
the penalties attaching to the offence, obtained
the living in 1360, and held it nineteen years.
In 1366, he was nominated Prebendary of
Fenton, in York Cathedral, which he exchanged
for that of Friday Thorpe in the same cathedral,
1376, and the same year was appointed Archdeacon
of Cornwall, and Prebendary of Wells. In
1380, he was constituted Dean of Salisbury, and
a few months after exchanged his archdeaconry
for the rectory of Bideford, resigning at the same
time the rectory of Hinton. The following year,
by virtue of a Bull of Pope Urban <abbr title="the sixth">VI.</abbr>, he was
appointed sixty-third Bishop of London,
succeeding Courtney, who had been translated
to Canterbury in place of Archbishop Sudbury,
who had been beheaded on Tower Hill three
months before by the Wat Tyler insurgents.</p>

<p>Braybrooke lived in one of the most important
periods in the annals of England—a transition
period—when the religious, political, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>intellectual systems of the country were experiencing
earthquake-throes, essential in working
out that liberty and social civilization which we
now enjoy.</p>

<p>In the early portion of his life, the
throne was occupied by "the greatest of the
Plantagenets;" in his middle life, by one of the
weakest; and the latter portion witnessed that
change of dynasty which resulted in the Wars of
the Roses, sweeping off vast numbers of the
Norman lords, and leaving England more Saxon
than it had been since the Conquest. In the
century preceding his birth the feudal barons had
been struggling with John and Henry <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>
against oppressive monarchial prerogative; had
wrested from John the Magna Charta; and
under the leading of Simon de Montfort, had in
the latter reign summoned the first representative
Parliament. And now the mass of the people—who
had remained serfs, mere chattels, who could be
bought and sold like cattle—rose under Wat
Tyler and Jack Straw to assert their rights,
proclaiming that all men were by nature equally
free, and demanding the abolition of serfdom, the
abrogation of unjust and oppressive laws, open
markets, etc., adopting as their motto,&nbsp;—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse">Who was then the gentleman?"</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Their demands eventuated in certain
concessions; but it was not until the Stuarts, by
their exaggerated notions of kingly prerogative,
had precipitated rebellion, that the liberties of
England were established on a sure foundation by
the victories of Cromwell. It was the period,
too, of the commencement of the struggle with
Rome for liberty of conscience. Never had
England sunk so low in degradation as in 1213,
when John, after boldly defying the Pope, found
himself compelled to lay his crown at the feet of
Pandulph. But now, "the morning star of the
Reformation" was, by voice and pen, awakening
the people to a consciousness of their slavery to a
foreign priest, proclaiming that the Scriptures
were the only rule of faith, and asserting the
right of private judgment. Under the
vigorous rule of the third Edward, the authority
of the Pope in the realm was materially curbed,
and enactments made declaring John's submission
illegal, lacking, as it did, the assent of the
representatives of the people, and making it penal
to publish bulls, or any other Papal instruments, in
the kingdom without the consent of Parliament.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless the Lollards were looked upon
as heretics by the authorities of the Church, and
in 1377, Wyclif was cited to appear before the
Primate and Bishop Courtnay in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's
Cathedral. He went thither accompanied by his
patrons, John of Gaunt and the Earl Marshal
(Lord Henry Percy), when the latter, in
consideration of the age and feebleness of the
venerable reformer, desired him to be seated,
"which," says Foxe, "eftsoons cast the Bishop of
London into a furious chafe," which resulted in
an altercation, the abrupt breaking up of the
assembly, and the rush of the London mob, with
whom the Duke of Lancaster was not then
popular, to his palace of the Savoy, where they
murdered a priest, but were dispersed by the
Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>After the murder of Archbishop Sudbury and
the elevation of Courtnay to the primacy, he
called a synod together at the House of the
Preaching Friars, London, at which the new
bishop (Braybrooke) attended. Soon after their
assembling, a shock of an earthquake occurred,
which alarmed the ecclesiastics, but Courtnay
adroitly turned it to account, saying that
earthquakes were but the expulsion of noxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>vapours from the earth, and it was a sign that
Heaven looked with approval on their efforts to
expel noxious doctrines from the Church, and the
meeting very speedily pronounced fourteen of
Wyclif's tenets erroneous or heretical.</p>

<p>This was, however, but the seed-time of
religious liberty; the seeds, nevertheless, in spite
of opposition, fructified under Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr> and
his daughter Elizabeth, grew apace under the
Commonwealth, and the harvest was reaped after
the expulsion of the second James.</p>

<p>Intellectually, too, Braybrooke was the
contemporary of the transition from ignorance to
learning. Chaucer, in his <cite>Canterbury Pilgrims</cite>,
and Gower in his <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite>, were laying
the foundation of our modern language and
literature; and Faust, Gutenberg, and Schœffer
were establishing their printing presses in
Germany, to be introduced into England by
Caxton in the next century, to aid in the
diffusion of knowledge, and in the liberation
of the people from political and spiritual
thraldom.</p>

<p>When Braybrooke, half a millennium ago, was
elevated to the episcopal bench, London was
a comparatively small city, encircled by two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>miles of walls, gates, and ditch, with but one
bridge over the Thames—that built by Peter of
Colechurch, with its movable centre for the
passage of vessels. The Tower was the Court
and king's residence; with Baynard's Castle, in
Thames Street; the magnificent Palace of the
Savoy, the Monastery of the Knights Hospitallers,
in Clerkenwell, and many another noble edifice
lay in ruins, demolished by the Wat Tyler
insurgents; the city was crowded with monasteries
and churches; and the streets presented a
mingled crowd of nobles, monks, friars, priests,
and merchant burghers.</p>

<p>His cathedral was that which had risen on the
ruins of the one destroyed by fire in the reign of
the Conqueror, which had been 200 years in
course of erection, and now stood forth a grand
building, covering four acres of ground, with its
Norman nave, two transepts, its pointed Gothic
choir, its spire, 510 feet in height, and its
beautiful Ladye Chapel, majestic in its magnitude,
and beautiful in some of its details; with <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr>
Paul's cross outside, where, every Sunday, some
eloquent friar or priest addressed the citizens;
and where many a memorable political sermon has
been preached. On the northern side, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>Warwick Lane, stood his residence, the Bishop's
palace, described as being "a stately and spacious
pile."</p>

<p>Internally he found the ecclesiastics in a lax
state of discipline, and "the house of God a den
of thieves." The cathedral was devoted more to
secular than to religious uses. "The south alley
for usury, the north for simony, and a horse fair
in the midst, for all kinds of bargains, meetings,
brawlings, murthers, and conspiracies; and the
font for the payment of money;" which were
associated with the shooting of arrows, ball
playing, and deeds even more reprehensible than
these. These abuses he set himself to correct,
and effected a great reformation. The sacred
edifice was also a sort of theatre, where mystery
and miracle plays were performed, the stage
consisting of three platforms, the upper representing
the Creator, surrounded by angels; the
second occupied by apostles, saints, and martyrs;
and the lower presenting the mouth of hell,
vomiting flames and smoke, and resounding with
the shrieks of the lost. But it pleased the taste
of the age that the monarch of the nether regions
should correspond with the clown of the modern
pantomime; and in the midst of solemn passages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>the devil, with a troop of his imps, would issue
forth, to perform all sorts of antics, and regale
the ears of the audience with drolleries, filth,
and what would now be considered blasphemy.
With these representations the bishop did not
interfere, considering them the only mode of
appealing to the hearts and consciences of the
ignorant multitude; unless, indeed, he sanctioned
the petition of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Players to Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>,
to prohibit ignorant and inexperienced persons
from "acting the History of the Old Testament
to the prejudice of the clergy of the Church."
A favourite device of these plays was the
descent of a white dove from an aperture of
the roof, with the swinging of censers, to
represent the descent of the Third Person in the
Trinity.</p>

<p>On the surrender of the chancellorship by Sir
Richard Scrope, 1382, "Robert Braybrooke,
Bishopp of London," says Speed, "was made
chancellor in his place. This act of the King's
was displeasant to the whole realme, and one of
the first things by which hee fell into dislike, it
being among the infelicities of King Richard that
those times were too full of sower and impatient
censors for a Prince of so calme a temper, and as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>yet unseasoned in yeares, but hee onely held the
office a yeare."</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristic of Braybrooke's
career was his unrelenting persecution of the
Lollards. It was enacted, 5 Richard <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, that
any person preaching against the Catholic Faith
should be imprisoned until he could "justify
himself;" and 2 Henry <abbr title="the fourth">IV.</abbr> that all persons
"suspected" of heresy should be imprisoned until
they were "canonically purged," or until they
abjured their errors, and that if they persisted in
their heresy they should be delivered to the
secular arm and "burnt to death before the
people." Toleration was a word not known in
that age. The oppressed ever cried out for
liberty of conscience, whether Romanist or
Reformer, but when they became the dominant
power they were alike intolerant; and the
cruelties of the bishop to the Lollards must be
ascribed to the spirit of the age, backed by his
own intense conviction that the Romanist was
the one "sole Apostolic Church," and that to
destroy the enemies who were beleaguering her
was doing a service to God.</p>

<p>The bishop appears to have always been on
friendly terms with the citizens of London, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>was, with the Duke of Gloucester, instrumental
in the reconciliation of King Richard and the
Corporation after their serious quarrel about a
loan of £1,000, afterwards heading a procession
of 400 citizens on horseback to tender their
submission, on which occasion a fountain of wine
was set playing at the door of the cathedral, and
the streets presented an animated spectacle, with
streaming banners and tapestries hanging in
front of the houses, the whole enlivened with
instrumental music.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his conservative sentiments,
he welcomed the landing of Bolingbrooke,
assisted actively in the deposition of Richard,
was one of the signers of the document consigning
him to perpetual imprisonment, which meant
death, within the walls of "bloody Pomfret," and
crowned the usurper; afterwards conducting a
service in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, at which King Henry was
present, when the corpse of the murdered
Richard was exposed there, to certify to the
citizens that he was really dead, and obviate the
possibility of revolts in his name.</p>

<p>Bishop Braybrooke died in the year 1404 (his
epitaph says 1405), and he was buried in the Ladye
Chapel of his cathedral, under "a faire marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>stone inlaide with letters made every one of a
several piece of brasse." Two-and-a-half centuries
after his burial the cathedral was destroyed in
the great fire of London, and on the removal of
the rubbish for the rebuilding the tomb was
found open, with the slab broken. "The body,"
as Camden states, "was found entire, the skin
still inclosing the bones and fleshy parts; only in
the breast there was a hole (made, I suppose, by
accident) through which one might view and
handle his lungs. The skin was of deep tawny
colour and the body very light, as appeared to
all who came to view and touch it, it being
exposed in a coffin for some time without any
offensive smell: and then reinterred."</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>A Brave Old London Bishop: Fulco Basset.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> the period when this prelate lived,
England was struggling to free itself from
the shackles of its Norman and Angevin rulers.
The feudal system had been introduced at the
Conquest, which constituted the king the absolute
master of the land; the barons were his vassals,
holding their lands by tenures of military service,
and the great mass of the people were either
vassals of the barons, holding portions of land by
knight's service, or were mere serfs, excepting
some merchants and traders in the cities and
towns, who enjoyed a modified species of freedom,
for which special charters were granted by kings.
The citizens of London have ever been famous for
the bold and resolute way in which they have
preserved and defended the liberties and
immunities granted in such charters, and when
Basset became their bishop they gladly welcomed
him as one who would not be backward in lending
them his countenance and assistance in any
attempted invasion of their chartered rights.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>Beyond this permissive freedom, however, they
aimed at something further; the notion that
kings were not the masters, but the servants, of
the sovereign people had been bruited abroad,
and the initiative had been taken by the barons,
who revolted against the tyranny of John, and
extorted from him the Magna Charta, in which
they were backed by the Londoners and the
merchants of other large towns; but the peasantry
and labourers were too much down-trodden in
serfdom to make any assertion of their natural
rights, and it was not until more than a century
afterwards that they, under Wat Tyler, Jack
Cade, and other leaders, began to put forth the
strange notion that they also were men with
natural rights, which they ceased not to reiterate,
until a couple of centuries afterwards they
established their claims at Marston Moor and
Naseby and Worcester.</p>

<p>Thurstan Basset came to England at the
Conquest, whose descendant Ralph (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr></i> Henry
<abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>,) by his great abilities raised the family to
distinction and wealth, and was the author of
many salutary laws, notably that of Frank
Pledge. From him issued three baronies by writ,
those of Basset of Sapcoate, 1264-1378; Basset
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>of Drayton, 1264, in abeyance 1390; and Basset
of Welden, 1299-1410.</p>

<p>Thomas, his second son, was founder of the
Wycombe branch, whose eldest son, Gilbert, had
issue by Egeline, daughter of —— Courtney, three
sons—Gilbert, Fulco, and Philip—all of whom
succeeded to the paternal estates, one after the
other.</p>

<p>Fulco was born at the end of the 12th century,
was brought up to the Church, and became
Provost of Beverley, 1206-1238; Rector of
Cottesbrook, Northants, which he resigned, 1239;
Dean of York, 1239-1242; Bishop of London,
1241-1258, but not consecrated until 1244, in
consequence of a vacancy in the See of
Canterbury. He died of the plague, 1258, and
was buried in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>In the year 1250, he had a warm altercation
with the Archbishop of Canterbury, relative to
metropolitical visitation, to which the archbishop
had an undoubted right, but which Basset denied.
"Comming to London, Boniface (the archbishop)
tooke a small occasion to defoce the bishop with
fowle and reprochfull speeches, and being resisted
by the Dean and Chapter of Paules (who had
appealed from his visitation to the Pope), he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>made no more adoo but excommunicated them
every one." The next day he proceeded to
the priory of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew, in Smithfield,
telling the sub-prior and monks, who came in
their copes to meet him, that he had come to
visit them, who replied very respectfully that
"they knew their bishop (whose only office it
was) to be a very sufficient man in his
place," and that, "although they were sorry to
disappoint him, they could not recognise any
other." "This answere so enraged this lusty
Archbishop, as not being able to containe his anger
within any bounds of discretion, he ranne
violently to the Sub Prior, strucke the poore old
man downe to the ground, kicked him, beate him
and buffeted him pitifully, tore his coape from his
backe, rent it into a number of pieces, and when
he had so done stamped upon it like a madde
man." His followers also fell upon the monks,
and a general fight took place; but the Londoners
hearing of the fray took up cudgels in
behalf of their bishop and prior, when the
archbishop took to flight, and got safely across the
ferry to Lambeth. "If they (the Londoners)
could have met with him, they would surely have
hewen him into a thousand peeces." As soon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>he got home he excommunicated the whole of the
inmates of the priory, and along with them
Bishop Basset. Appeals on both sides were
made to Rome, the Dean of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's going
thither, followed by the archbishop. A great
deal of bribery took place, the Pope pocketing
the proceeds from both parties alike, and delaying
his decision in order to exact more money, which
seems not to have been spared. At length he
gave judgment that the archbishop had the
right of visitation all through his province, but
for the unseemly brawling and fighting in
Smithfield he condemned him to rebuild, at his
own cost, Lambeth Palace, which was then in a
dilapidated condition.</p>

<p>Although he was ever zealous and earnest in his
defence of the people against kingly and priestly
tyranny, and supported the barons in this and
the preceding reign, it was in his old age, when
verging upon the grave, that Basset especially
made a display of that bravery and sturdy
English love of freedom and hatred of oppression
which entitles him to the designation at the head
of this chapter.</p>

<p>King Henry and the Pope had conspired
together to levy a tax on the English clergy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>share the plunder. Rustand, the Pope's legate,
with this view, convoked a meeting of the clergy
of London, and made his demand in the name
of the Pope. Basset rose and replied, in
unmeasured terms, on the illegality and oppressive
nature of the exaction, finishing by saying that
rather than submit to so intolerable a demand
he would lose his head, and in this he was backed
by his clergy, who passed an unanimous resolution
to ignore any such claim altogether. The legate
laid his complaint before the king, who sent for
the bishop, abused him with vile and menacing
language, and threatened him with deprivation
and Papal censure. Basset listened meekly to
all the king had to say, but when he left his
presence he said to those who he knew would
carry it to the king, "He may remove my mitre,
if it so pleases him, but he will find a helmet
beneath it, and he may take away my crosier, but
that is easily replaced with a sword."</p>

<p>M. Paris says of him, "He was a noble and
honourable man, and, excepting his last slip, the
anchor of the whole kingdom, and the shield of
stability and defence." Weever also says, "As
he was a man of great lineage, and also of ample—both
temporal and ecclesiastical—possessions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>so he was a prelate of an invincible, high spirit;
stout and courageous to resist those insupportable
exactions which the Pope's legate, Rustandus,
went about to lay upon the clergie."</p>

<p>In the year 1256 he commenced the erection
of the church of <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Faith, under <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's
cathedral, founded a charity in <abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Paul's for the
repose of his soul, and bequeathed to the
cathedral a golden apple, two carved chests for
relics, some vestments, and a few manuscripts.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>


<h2>An Old London Diarist.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the sixteenth century there dwelt in the
parish of Holy Trinity the Less, Queenhithe,
a worthy and honest citizen, one Henry Machyn,
a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company.
He was born about the period of the accession of
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, and lived until after the accession
of Elizabeth, dying, it is presumed, in 1563, of the
plague which visited London in that year, when
his diary comes to an abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>The age in which he lived was a most
important period, that of the transition from
Popery to Protestantism, accompanied by the
discords, troubles, evil passions, and cruelties
incidental to transitional epochs. During his life,
he witnessed not less than three changes in the
national faith: First, the rejection of the Papal
supremacy, the suppression of monasteries, and
the establishment of the reformed religion under
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>; secondly, a return to the old Papal
allegiance and faith at the accession of Mary;
and thirdly, the final downfall of Popery, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>Elizabeth. Our diarist, although, like the Vicar
of Bray, he seems to have accommodated his
conscience to the prevailing religion, evidently
had a leaning towards the old faith, which
is manifested by the gusto with which he
describes the Church ceremonies and regal
pageants of Mary's reign, and the "sarve them
right" sort of style in which he records the
pillorying, whipping at cart-tails, and lopping off
the ears of utterers of "haynous wordes aganst
the Queen's magesty," as compared with the
somewhat despondent tone of the entries after
the accession of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It would appear, although not stated, that he
was a purveyor of trappings for pageants and
funerals, heraldic painter, and undertaker in
general; his place of business was near to the
Painterstainers' Hall and the College of Arms;
and it is supposed that he kept several workmen
employed in emblazoning flags, pennons,
escutcheons, etc., for public processions and
spectacles.</p>

<p>The diary at the beginning appears to have
been nothing more than a trade record, consisting
almost entirely of notices of funerals and the
pomp thereof, most probably those which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>conducted himself. Afterwards he notices other
pageants—Lord Mayors' Shows, Royal processions,
guild companies' displays, etc., in most
of which he would probably have some professional
connexion. Subsequently he records
notable events outside his profession, such as
"preching at Powlle's Crosse;" changes in
religion; proceedings of Queen Mary, her
marriage, etc.; the punishing of heretics on the
gallows and at the stake; standings in the
"pelere;" "rydyngs in Chepe;" penance in
churches; and sundry other events of a similarly
lively character, which were marked features of
the time.</p>

<p>The diary is remarkably free from egotism,
being written throughout in the third person,
even when speaking of himself or family, which is
very seldom. The following entries relate to
himself and family: 1. 1550, the funeral of his
brother—"30th November was bered Crystoffe
Machyn, Marchand Tayllor in the parryche of
Sant James and broder of Henry Machyn: the
Cumpene of Marchand Tayllors behyng at the
berehyng and the Compene of the Clarkes
syngyng and—Maydwell dyd pryche for hym."
2. The birth of a daughter. September 25th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>1557; he writes that his wife was "browth a 'bed
with a whenche," that she was attended by his
"gossip Master Harper," who was surgeon
accoucheur to the Queen; and that two days
after was "chrysten'd Katheryn, doythur of Hare
(Harry) Machyn;" further that "Mistress
Grenway, an Altherman's wife, and Masters
Blakwelle and Grenwell" were the sponsors. 3.
A notice of his own doing penance, but recorded
in the third person and with a Frenchifying of
his name. "November 23rd, 1561: the third
yere of Quen Elesabeth, dyd preche at Powlle's
crosse, Renager, yt was Sant Clement Day; dyd
syt alle the sermon tym Henry des Machyn for
two (words) the wyche was tolde hym, that
Veron, the French—the precher was taken wyth
a wenche, by the reporting, by on (one) Wylliam
Lawrence, dark of Sant Mare (Mary) Maudlen,
in Mylke Streete; the wych the same Hare
(Harry) kneelyd down before Master Veron and
the byshopp, and yett (they) would nott for
(forgive) hym for alle ys fryndes that he hadde
worshepefulle." 4. Marriage of his niece. July
7th, 1562, "that Symon Smith browth to the
Gyldhalle, Kynlure Machen for to have lyssens
(licence) to have her a husband, Edw. Gardener,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>Cowper ... dowther of Cristofer Machyn."
These are all the references to himself and family,
but there is a memorandum on one of the sheets
of a business nature, which indicates his having
been an emblazoner of arms: "Rember yt my
lade (Lady) Masum byll for armes,"—the rest
illegible.</p>

<p>The diary extends from 1550 to 1563; it is
couched in language and orthography which
denote deficient education even for that time,
but is valuable as a reliable record of events,
interesting as a picture of the age, and amusing
from its quaint style. Strype made great use of
it in the way of quotation in his <cite>Ecclesiastical
Memorials</cite>, as a trustworthy authority. The MS.
is in the Cotton collection. It suffered in the fire at
Sir Robert Cotton's house, Westminster, and now
remains in a fragmentary form, being much
scorched and burnt at the edges. In the year
1848, it was published by the Camden Society,
edited by Mr. John Gough Nichols, F.S.A.,
with a glossary, notes, etc.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the diary give a
vivid picture of London 300 years ago; the tone
of public opinion, and the turbulence of the time,
with the picturesque accessories of pageants and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>processions, and the less pleasing but ever present
spectacles of whipping, pillorying, hanging,
quartering, and burning of heretics and rebels.</p>

<p>1. The restored Papal rule. Queen Mary
ascended the throne in 1553, and immediately
reversed all the doings of her father and brother
in matters of religion. Thus writes Machyn:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"August 5th, 1553. Cam out of the
Marselsay the old Bishop of London, Bonar, &amp;
dyvers bysshopes bryngyng him unto home ye
plasse at Powlces, &amp; doctor Coke whent to the
same plass yn the Marselsey that the bysshope
was in."</p>

<p>February 12th, 1573-4. After Wyatt's rebellion
"there was mad at evere gate in Lundun a newe
payre of galous, &amp; set up 11 payre in Cheapside;
11 payre in Fletstrett, 1 in Smythfyld, 1 in
Holborne, 1 at Ledyn-hall, 1 at Sant Magnus,
London Bridg, one at Refer Allay Gatt, one at
Sant George's, 1 at Borunsay (Bermondsey)
strett, 1 on Towr hylle, 1 payre at Charyng
Crosse, and 1 payre besyd Hyd Parke corner."
The executions took place on the 14th, and "on
the <abbr title="fourth">iiii</abbr> daye of junii wasse all the galus in
London plokyd done in all plases."</p>

<p>September 23rd, 1554. "Dyd pryche doctur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>Rud at Powlle's Crosse, and he recantyd and
repentyd that he ever was mared (married)
and sayd openly that he cold not mare by God's
law."</p>

<p>September 15th, 1556. "A sermon was
preached at Powlle's," when was declared, "the
Popes jubele and pardon from Rome, and as
mony as wyll rescyffe ye pardon so to be schryff
(shrived) and fast three days in on weeke and to
rescyff the blessed sacrament, the next Sunday
affter, clen remyssyon of alle ther synnes tossyens
quossyens (<em>? toties quoties</em>) of all that ever they
dyd."</p>

<p>March 25th, 1556. A grand day at Bow
Church. "Our Lady Day, the Annunsyasyon,
at Bow Chyrch was hangyd wyth cloth of gold
and with rich hares (arras) and cossens (cushions)
for the commyng of my Lord Cardenal Pole.
Ther dyd the Bysshop of Vossetr (Worcester)
syng he (high) masse, mytyred, and ther were
dyver bysshopes, as the B. of Ely, London, and
Lynkkolne, and the Yerle of Pembroke, and Ser
Edw. Hastynges, the Master of the Horse, and
dyvers odur nobul" (unfinished).</p>

<p>It seems there were those in London who did
not approve of the Queen's proceedings, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>resorted to violent measures, besides Sir Thomas
Wyatt and his followers. 1554-5. "The 17th
day of Feybuary, at about mydnight, ther wer
serten lude feylows cam unto Sant Thomas of
Acurs, and over the dore ther was set the ymage
of Sant Thomas, and ther they brake ys neke and
the tope of ys crosier, the wych was mad of fre
stone. With grett sham was yt done." On
March 14th, the same year, "Serten velyns dyd
breke the neke of the ymage of Sant Thomas of
Cantarbere, and on of ys arms broke."</p>

<p>The next day was issued, "A proclamassyon
that wo so ever cold bring word to the mare who
dyd breke ys neke shuld have C. (100) croones of
gold for his labur." He does not state whether
the iconoclasts were discovered. There are
numberless entries also, such as the following:
"July 24th, 1553, was a felow set in the pelere
[pillory] for speykyng agaynst the good Quen
Mare." September 17th, 1557, "Ther whent
out of Newgatt unto Yylyngton beyond the
buttes, towards the cherche, in a valey, to be
borned, four—three men, on woman, for herese
duly—two of them was man and wyfe dwellyng
in Sant Dunstan's in the East." November
12th, 1558. "Saturday, ther was a woman sett
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>on the pelere for sayhing that the Quen was ded
and her Grace was not ded."</p>

<p>After the death of Queen Mary, we read:
"August 24th. (The Lord) Mare and the
althermen and the (sheriffs) wher at the
wrastleyng at Clarke in Well, and it was the
fayre daye of thynges kept in Symthfeld, Sant
Bathellmuw, and the same daye my lorde

Yrmonger (lane), and agaynst Sant Thomas of
Ocurs two gret (bonfires) of rodes (crosses) and of
Mares (images of the Virgin Mary) and Johns
and odur emages ther they wher bornyd with
gret wondur."</p>

<p>Also, in the same year: "The tyme afor
Bathell muwtyd and after was alle the rodes
(crosses), and Mares and Johns, and many
odur of the cherche gudes both copes,
crosses, censers, altar-clothes, rod-clothes, bokes,

were all destroyed); and ther was a felow within
the chyrche (<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Botolph, Bishopsgate Street)
mad a sermon at the bornyng of the chyrch
goodes."</p>

<p>2. Funerals.—In describing these the author is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>quite at home, with his penons and skotchons,
and torchys and blake clokes, which he catalogues
minutely. These occupy about half the diary.
Be it also observed that Englishmen then, like
Englishmen of the nineteenth century, could not
assemble for any purpose or conclude any
regal or civic procession without a "gret
dener."</p>

<p>"May 20th, 1551, was bered my lade (Lady)
Hobullthorne, late (Mayoress) of London, with 2
herolds, 4 penons of armes, and ther was (the)

<p>In the same year was buried "Richard

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>At the burial of Master Robin, of Mark Lane,
in Barking church, the street and church being
hung with black cloth, and the Lord Mayor and
Alderman. After an account of the heraldic and
other paraphernalia, he concludes, "and affter
they whent to dener for thys was affor none."</p>

<p>The following describes the funeral of Sir John
Gresham, uncle to Sir Thomas Gresham, the
builder of the Royal Exchange, who was
apprenticed to him. He served the office of
Sheriff in 1537, and that of Lord Mayor in
1547.</p>

<p>"Oct. 30th, 1556, was bered Ser John

<p>3. Pageants, Processions, and Feasts.—The
following are samples of a great number of similar
entries:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>1551. "The 2d daye of Nov. cam to London
from Hamton Courtte and landyd at Benerd
Castyll, the old Qwyne of Schottes" (this would be
Mary, daughter of Claude de Lorraine, Duke of
Guise, who married King James <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> of Scotland
in 1515, was mother of Mary Queen of Scots,
and died in 1560), "and cam rydyng to the
bysshope pallas at Powlles, with many lordes, the
Duke of Suffolke, &amp;c.... and then the Qwyne
and alle her owne lades and her gentyll women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>was to the nombre of C (100), and ther was sent
her mony grett gyftes by the Mayre and Aldermen
as beyffes, mottuns, velles, swines, bred,
wylld ffule, wynes, bere, spysys, and alle thinges,
and qwaylles, sturgeon, wod and colles, and
samons by dyvers men," and very useful
"gyfftes" too, although the "qwaylles," if by
that whales are meant, would be rather cumbrous
presents to take away with her, but possibly they
were quails.</p>

<p>"September 30th, 1552, the Mayre and the
alderman and the new shreyffes took berges at
<abbr title="three">III</abbr> Cranes in the Vyntre, and so to Westmynstre
Hall, and ther they tote hoyth (oath) in the
excheker, and then they cam to dener. Ther
was as grett a dener as youe have sene, for ther
wher mony gentyll men and women."</p>

<p>In 1553 the new Lord Mayor went to Westminster,
attended by "the craftes of London in
ther best liveray, with trumpets blohyng and
whets (waits) playing, ... all the craftes
barges with stremers and banars, and so to the
cheker, and so homwards." They landed at
"Banard Castyll," and arranged a procession in
"Powlle's Chyrche yerde." ... "Furst wher
2 tall men bayreng 2 great stremors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>Marchand Tayllers' armes; then cam on (with a)
drume and a flutt playing, and a nodur with a
gret f——, and alle they in blue sylke; and then
cam 2 gret wodyn (woodmen) with 2 gret clubes,
alle in grene and with skwybes (squibs) bornyng,
with gret berds and syd here (great beards and
side hair), and 2 targetts upon their bakes ...
and then cam <abbr title="sixteen">XVI.</abbr> trumpetrs blohyng ...
and then a duyllyll (devil); and after cam
the bachelors alle in a leveray and skarlett hods;
and then cam Sant John Baptyst, gorgyusly, with
goody speches ... and then my Lord
Mayre and 2 good henchmen, and then alle the
althermen and shreyffes, and so to dener, and
after dener to Powlle's, and alle them that bere
tergetts dyd (bear) after stayff torchys with all
the trumpets and wettes (waits) blowhyng, thrugh
Powlles, round abow the quiers and the body of
the chyrche blowhyng, and so home to my Lord
Mere's howsse."</p>

<p>"July 2nd, 1555, was the Merchand Tayllers'
fest, and ther dyned my Lord Mayre and dyvers
of the counselle and juges, and the shreyffes, and
mony althermen and gentyllmen, and they had
agaynst ther dener 58 bokes (bucks) and two
stages (stags)." A somewhat plentiful banquet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>after which followed the appointment of the
warden and other officers for the ensuing year.
"Alle five borne in London, and tayller sounes
alle."</p>

<p>"1556. The furst daye of September was
Sant Gylles Day, and ther was a goodly
procession abowt the parryche (<abbr title="saint">St.</abbr> Giles',
Cripplegate), with the whettes (waits), and the
canape borne and the sacrament, and ther was a
goodly masse songe as bene herd (as has been
heard), and Master Thomas Grenelln, wax-chandler,
mad a grett dener for Master Garter
and my lade (lady), and Master Machylle the
shereyff and ys wyff, and boyth the chamberlayns,
and mony worshepefull men and women at dener,
and the whettes playing and dyvers odur
mynstrelles, for ther was a grett dener."</p>

<p>"10th June, 1560. Feast of the compane of
Skyners and ther mony worshepefull men wher
at dener, for ther was a worshepefull dener."
After which is narrated the election of the master
and other officers of the company for the coming
year, "and Master Clareshur mad a grett bankett
for the master and hys compene, furst spysed
bred, cheres (cherries), straberes, pepyns, and
marmalade and suckett comfets, and portingalles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>(Portugal oranges), and dyvers odur dyssays,
(dishes), epocres, rennys (Rhenish wine), claret
wyne, and bere, and alle grett plente and alle was
welcome." Not quite so substantial a repast as
that of the Merchant Taylors with their 58
bucks and 2 stags.</p>

<p>4. Amusements.—Although the fires of Smithfield
during the reign of Mary overcanopied the
City with a cloud of gloom, and notwithstanding
the people had a constant source of delectation in
witnessing the hangings and quarterings, and
ear-lopping on pillories, the whippings at
cart-tails, and the penance-doing at Paul's Cross,
of rogues and heretics, they found time to amuse
themselves in other ways, sometimes perhaps in
sports of a rough and barbarous character, at
others of a simpler and unobjectionable nature, of
which the favourite was dancing round the
maypole, but always accompanied by loud
and boisterous shouts of merriment. Machyn
frequently refers to these pastimes. The
following are specimens:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"May 26th, 1552. Cam into Fa(nchurch)
parryche a goodly maypole as you h(ave seen),
pentyd whyt and gren, and ther the men and
women dyd wher abowt ther neke baldrykes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>whyt and gren: the gyant, the mores danse, and
the —— had a castylle in the myd with pensels
and a —— plasys of sylke and gilded, and the
sam (day the) Lord Mayre by conselle causyd yt
to be (taken) done and broken."</p>

<p>"December 9th, 1554. At afternon was a
bere baytin on the Banksyde, and ther the grett
blynd bere broke losse, and on runnyng away he
chakt (caught) a servyng manne by the calff of
the legge and bit a grett pease away, and after
by the hokyl (ancle) bone, that within 3 days after
he ded (died)."</p>

<p>"1557. May 30th was a goly (jolly) May-game
in Fanchyrch Street, with drumes and gunes and
pykes, and nine wordes (worthies) dyd ryd; and
they had speches evere man, and the morris dansse,
and the saudon (soldan or sultan) and a elevant
(elephant) with a castyll and the sauden and young
morens (Moors) with targettes and darttes, and the
lord and lade of the Maye."</p>

<p>The sextons' merry-making was of a more
sober kind as befitted their craft, thus: "1554.
June 25th, anodur masse kept at the Gray freers
for the saxtons of London and after pressessyon,
with the whetes plahyng and clarkes syngyng
thrug Chepesyd unto Soper Lane and again thrug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>Powlles-chyrchyard, by master denes (house) and
thrug Warwick Lane unto Gray freers, and so to
dener unto the Kukes' (Cooks') hall."</p>

<p>5. Punishment.—"November 4th, 1554. Master
Harpfield preched at Powlles Crosse, when
ther wher fyve did penans with shetts (sheets)
abowt them and tapurs and rods in ther handes,
and the prycher dyd stryke them with a rod,
and ther did they stand tyll the sermon was well
done. On of these was a priest some tyme
chanon at Eyssyng Spyttyll; three of them
were relegyous men (monks or friars), and the
fifth a temporall man that had two wyeffes."</p>

<p>"1559. The 20th August was Sonday: ther
was a sarmon at Powlles Crosse; ys name was
——, and ther was a menester dyd penans for the
marchyng of a setenn cupolle that was mared
(married) afor tym."</p>

<p>"1551, May 2nd. The same day was hangd
at Tyburne <abbr title="nine">IX</abbr> fellows. The same year on the
12th September there was hanged <abbr title="nine">IX</abbr> women
and <abbr title="two">II</abbr> men."</p>

<p>"1562, June 27th. Whent to Tyburne; <abbr title="five">V</abbr>
men and <abbr title="six">VI</abbr> women for to hange for theft."</p>

<p>These were "the good old times" that poets
rave about.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>"1554. The <abbr title="seventeenth">XVII</abbr> day of Septembre a
proclamasyon that alle vacabonds and loitherus
boyth Englysmen and alle maner of strangers
that have no master should avoid the cete (City)
and subarbes apon gret pain." An edict which
appears to have been speedily put in force, as we
read a day or two after:&nbsp;—</p>

<p>"Two men wher wyped about London after a
carts hors for loythring, and as wagabones."
Also, "A lad was wypd at the post in Chepe for
ronnyng abowt masterless as a vagobond."</p>

<p>"August 19th, 1552. Ther was a mon in the
(pillory) in Chepe for spykyng agaynst the
Mayre and his br(ethren)."</p>

<p>"1559. Desembre 18th, did a woman ryd
upone (a horse) with a paper on her bed for
boderie with a basen ryngyng."</p>

<p>1558-9, February 18th and 20th. "A man
stood in the pelere with a coler of smelts aboutt
his neke for buying them as taken for the
Qhwen" (by pre-emption) "and sold them at his
vantage amonge the fyswyffes."</p>

<p>"November 29th, 1560. Ther was a man ryd
for bryngyng messele (measly) porke to selle."
A very wholesome punishment, which might be
revived with advantage amongst some of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>sausage dealers. It would appear that the
French notion of John Bull selling his wife in
Smithfield is not altogether without foundation,
as we read: "The <abbr title="twenty-third">XXIII</abbr> day of Novembre,
1553, dyd ryd in a cort cheken parsun of sant
Necolas Cold Abby round abowt London, for he
sold ys wyff to a bowcher."</p>

<p>"1561. June 25th. Two pelores in Chepsyd,
wher wer sett seven men for kungaryng
(conjuring)." It is fortunate for Messrs.
Maskelyne and Cook that they live in the
nineteenth and not in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>"1555. <abbr title="twenty-ninth">XXIX</abbr> April, a man bawd was putte
in the pelore for bryngyng men's prentes
(tradesmen's apprentices) harlots, the wyche they
gayff hym and them serten of their masters'
goodes and wasted." And richly did the rascal
deserve the punishment; it is to be hoped he was
well pelted with rotten eggs.</p>

<p>Ring-dropping appears not to be a modern
dodge of roguery, but of the venerable age of
three centuries at least, for we find that in 1553,
April 17th, "a man was put in the pelere for
fasshele (falsely) deseyvyng of the Qhwens
subgettes, sellyng of ryngs for golde and was
nodur seylver nor golde but cowper, the wyche
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>he has deseyved money; thys was done in
Chepe." Also on July 3rd in the same year, "A
man was wypyd abowtt the post of reformacyon
(a very good name) be the standard in Chepsyd
for sellyng of false ryngs."</p>

<p>The year 1557 was a glorious one for householders,
for on September 5th in that year "was
a proclamasyon mad that the bochers of London
shold selle beyffe and moton and velle, the best
for a penny fordyng the pound, and nekes and
legges at <abbr title="three">iii</abbr> fordynges the pound, and the lambe
the quorter <abbr title="eight pence">viiid.</abbr>, and yff they wyll not thay
loysse ther fredom for ever and ever."</p>

<p>The fire brigade of 1557 was on a very
moderate scale as compared with that of the
present year of grace, and the members had
charitable and religious duties imposed on them
which the brigade of modern times would scarcely
consider as coming within the sphere of
their duty. We read: "Jan. 7th, 1556-7, in
Chosdwener Street Word a bellman was appointed
to go round the ward and ring his bell at the
strett ends in case of fire, and to helpe the powre
(poor) and pray for the ded."</p>
